"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","In the other room, I'll be right back."
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Alright.Yep.
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","OK, sorry about that."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",No.
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, I'm good."
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Sure.
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Do you wanna go first though? Or you want me to?
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",You can go 1st and talk about our section I guess.You want to.
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",OK.Umm.I have been in Sofam since January of 2004.Umm.So code management or their resource data management office was set up around.2006 early 2006 to actually put A to have some type of control over.The the systems aspect of what what we do.And the UM.
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yeah.
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Of the construct of the data that is used in the service accounting systems. So.We have am oversight over all of that because we were integrating all of that data, so.We don't have our own accounting system at SOCOM. We use the service systems.Which is intentional. And then we have a budget system at SOCOM that was also included in the resource Data Management Office configuration. So we have a group of developers in the that take care of the budget side and then code management which is manned with three or four people.Umm, depending on the day.Is it was set up to control the data and all of the service systems so that we could effectively bring it back together to integrate that data. So basically put us in the driver seat and the other thing that the RDM O if you will, the resource data management Office was set up to have complete oversight to training to the.Ah, systems that we control that headquarters, SOCOM. So we have that piece as well. So basically anything that was systems.Yeah, rolled into a new office starting in about. Thing was early, early 2000. It's got probably about 2006.So we have existed ever since, so that's.That's what we do. We control the the data that's in all of these, uh, these systems, so.We have communication methods that we do, uh, that we use to get that data out to to folks and then we we work with the services individually. So that's that at a high level of of what's going on. But basically anything with systems, financial systems or.The use of those financial systems to include deploying those systems.Umm, if one of our components deploys a new system, we make sure that the data that is residing in that system complies with.With our business processes and contains data that we need to March it back to the palm and budget if you will.Tell me what's uh?That's it."
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, that's."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","1111 different systems and then plus the the budget system. The Pbis miss, which is our budget system. So it's about 12.Yep. And now ivanna so."
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, same was my first name. I go by Doug. So if you ever seem that's, that's fine. Not a big deal."
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I have been at SOCOM since 2010. I've been in Sofom in and around Sofom since 2015. I was over as a budget analyst in another sick section.Uh, prior to going into RDM O and seven, I don't know, 17 or 18, I don't remember 18.My background is mostly Air Force.Accounting a budget, supply systems, travel systems, that kind of stuff. So in, in and around kind of the.Not.Not necessarily fully deploying accounting systems, but with DTS I was involved in doing DTS. I was involved with.The Air Force setting up their financial service center and just in and around stuff. So it was a good opportunity. It was a fun opportunity to come and work in.RDML where we have.Umm, you know, just the ability to kind of impact stuff at a?Had a different level. I know being a budget analyst, you kind of wanna get ahold of data or get of hold of things and it's just wasn't an easy there wasn't easy ways for us to kind of do stuff.And having the opportunity to be in RDMO and and being able to see how things work and be able to put things together differently and try to help other people.This kind of, yeah, I think I had a little bit of insight.That's kind of what users may have wanted to see.And then with Ivona coming on and just our efforts with.Trying to take this data at a different level of data and make it available to a whole new audience of people. It's been a it's been a fun thing so far, but all the things at best said lots of moving pieces.Like just looking at your checklist, none of none of those systems really talk to each other, so there's a lot of.There's a lot of translation going on and always like saying like.You know, I need to tell somebody something in Chinese, but I don't know Chinese. I don't know anybody that knows Chinese, but I know somebody knows German and they know somebody that knows French and that person knows how to speak Chinese. So.Sometimes that works, and sometimes you know it's like the telephone game with data. But.That's kind of what we do in the office. So that's it for me."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Multilingual.
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, yeah."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Umm so for for our budget, for our peace, our uh dollars, which you call a MFP 11. So comes got their own budget in the defense budget.Or carved out of the defense agencies budget, if you will so.Umm we have.I'm certain standards that we use one of them is the standard financial information structures, the called the ESPYs Library, OSD Comptroller.Owns and maintains that, along with uh de fastest standard physical code team at DFAST Indie and all of that data is actually published out onto a website.So we have a, you know, a baseline of what data elements should be used for what.And then we, uh, the premises is that those data elements can be used for SOCOM dollars as well. So we're not unique in the fact on how we track our stuff, right? Every defense agency and every service do it the same way.Umm, we track different things obviously because we're tracking soft costs.But.A long, long time ago, the first thing that happened was that we took control of that data in code management. So.And the Mart data, if you will, which is the the master data used in each one of those systems.Is centrally managed and controlled by code management.So we set up business processes and relationships with the services and whoever builds this data, whether it was defassa or one of the services.To ensure that nobody from the components or outside of software code management.Am built that Mart data all of it comes and was built through us. So we control that and then we publish that data on our our portal. We have a lot of different databases that House our, our our data elements. But what we do is publish it and what a standard format it's called the DFAS Manual 7097.Our data is in chapter three of that manual.The oversight of that manual is done by a deep pass indie, the standard fiscal code team, but our chapter, which also resides on the ESPYs library, is maintained and and published by us in code management. So every data element that anybody that is working in financial accounting systems.It's all listed there, it's, you know, the Rosetta Stone, if you will, of of what data goes where and is used for what. And then that data is linked back to the the budgetary data, which is also contained in that that manual. So that makes sense."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Now we control the data mark so.Umm there's help desk for all of these systems, right? And so like?Anytime that you need, you know a new user base or whatever, it's kind of like an avana, right? You you guys control who gets into Sparta."
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",See.
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","So, Umm, we do the same thing, but we have relationships with all of the Services Mart people. So if an accountant or a budget analyst at Headquarters Usasoc tries to go to the help desk to get something built in Gfebs which is their accounting system and it's for Pleven, they will not do it for that person. The only person or persons that can set up.Our data in those systems are in sophanem code management. We centrally manage the market process from here for 11 systems."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","So they're turned away basically at the door or double check. So those are the, you know, the relationships that we have with all of those folks."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. So just to give you an example of Umm in 2004, the data accuracy in the systems that we were using the systems of record recording now soft dollars was the accuracy was at about 35%.We are at a a well over 98% accurate at this point. There's always you know.Some type of of issues, right? Could be validated but not valid for the that type of thing. So we're at about we we maintain about 98 to 99% accuracy of our data in all of those systems today."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Well, we were measuring it in DC, DC W we are now going. We're transitioning to measure that data in that banana.So once it's warehoused, we can see whether it was used, uh, properly or not properly.And so there is reconciliations that take place to to make sure that we're In Sync with what's supposed to happen."
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Source.
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, the source is the system itself."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Umm.Well, we have relationships with you know, the the financial managers at you know, all of the T socks and all of the components. And then we insert ourselves in the business processes of the the financial system owners. So whether that's DLA or DFAS or the Army use of film com, the OR whoever owns the system.We also maintain relationships with those folks.So that our stuff or our equities basically are represented properly in the systems that we use. So it's a lot of touch points, if you will, but basically you know we're.You know, we just kind of shove our way through the doors and contact PMO's and say, hey, don't forget about us and oh, by the way, you can't do whatever you want to with our data. We control it from here."
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. And one of the things, one of the things for that, if we don't insert ourselves early into the process, since we're not an owner of any of these systems, we're kind of, we're just a user and not even that big of a user and a lot of a lot of times we're kind of overlooked. So the services will go and do what the services need to do. They'll make those changes. Our data is a little different. So if we're not, we're not involved with these PMOS and these and these business processes, sometimes things.Can get changed and a system that don't benefit us and actually hurt us. So like to best point being involved with the PMO's and making those point of contacts and just understanding how their systems work and being family, them being familiar enough with us that sometimes they they'll they'll stop and ask the question hey.How would this affect SOCOM? So that's that's the kind of relationship we want.Kind of a peer-to-peer thing, not just like a user of their system of."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Umm Yep.
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, yeah. Like we we just had a recent one where the Navy decided or, sorry, the Marine Corps as a whole changed their entire accounting system.So.You know, we have, we don't.We have marine units and those marine units are now going to be forced to use.That new system.And the Marine Corps is a whole wanted the Marine Corps to be standard in the same. So trying to make sure that our equities that SOCOM equities were captured or represented.In a way, we could use them and not just the way that was good for the service.Umm.Yeah, so trying to be involved early in that process, it didn't work out exactly the way we wanted it to, but we were able to get, we're able to use this system, I'll say that."
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yes.
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yeah.
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","In in in relationship with in relationship with others.We there's and and Beth will say there's a lot of.Let's try this and see if this works, because sometimes with data you we have to do that we don't know exactly.You know, we we know what maybe the."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Umm.
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","The first ripple is, but we don't know what the second, third and fourth quarter effects always are. So yeah, we do.We make things work.We yeah."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Are are we break them? So just to to bed sometimes on unintentionally. So if there's A and the services do the same thing, right? We're not unique in the. So there are times where we make a change to our data and don't really understand, you know, like Doug said, the 2nd, 3rd, 4th order effects cause most of the services are.Umm. And the legacy world? Or they have about 200 plus feeder systems to all of their accounting systems. So if you think about.Uh, your pay your, uh, DTS, your supplies, all of those feed accounting systems, right? I could go on and on and on.Uh, we potentially could break one of those links by making a change to the primary accounting system. The interface breaks or something. So we've done that. There's a lot of.Umm.Trial and error if you will.Sometimes."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Right. Well, if you think you know, if we change the line of accounting and the accounting system, we don't change the DTS budget label.You don't get paid after you travel, so you know that's a simple example, right?"
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","While we try not to make updates like those types of things more than once a year, so there's a there's a business process in place where, you know we do data calls, we make changes to to the systems.Umm, once a year, we published that data in the 7097 and then those who are affected, they go out and retrieve that and update their systems."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yep.
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Uh.
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Uh-huh.But.
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I'll. I'll see for me my background is not any of that, it's.It's I I think when you.I was in the Air Force and as you move through stuff.Uh, I I worked in systems in the Air Force, which is different than what we're doing here. But sometimes you just become that guy and then you get to do those things. So there's not a formal kind of process by which you would learn to do these things. You're either you can either say you're the right guy in the right place at the right time or you're the in the wrong place at the wrong time when some of these things land into your lap.So not speaking for Beth, but I think that's kind of along the same thing as you know, our system and you're in one place and you do something and then that gets on an eval or your name gets out there. You're like, hey, and then that's how that's how stuff happens. It becomes your job."
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Inadvertently.And and.
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. Well, especially yeah, like active duty. So I did 22 years active duty Air Force. So you know when you're active duty, sometimes you're you're.You know, volume told. If you become good at something. So my **** background was in, you know, budget and cost while I was active duty. But then I did so many systems implementations that you know you end up doing mostly that and and nothing else. So kind of like you know Doug in the same same situation I was like ohh this dude is good at this. So now he's gonna do this all the time."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. Everything else has been a learning experience. Nothing was actually a.I'm in a database. When I got to SOCOM, people were keeping yellow pads of paper.And they weren't really using an automated tool, so we set up multiple. We use access for all of our databases to store our data, and that's really all that we were that was available.Umm in 2004, so all of that has become, you know, automated in stored. So yeah, and if you don't know access take class, figure it out and you know, press on, that's just the way that we were all."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, that's what we're doing with Advana too. So you know, Doug and I both take classes and then we got Nick. You know, we're hoping that he can learn this stuff and give us some insights. So you could just gotta roll with the punches and, you know, just don't blanks. It'll change tomorrow."
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","There, there's a lot of info on Google and YouTube too, so that's always good."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. So the, uh, the 7097 databases are in access and then we had databases that were the the.That contained all of the.Mom and Dad precursor code to advana for what is in the devas system, the DC DW which was the warehouse there. Those are also an access. There's about you know there's.Quite, quite a few databases that that run that uh, that that crosswalk is to store those tables and then run the crosswalks. All of that is in excess.And then on the budget side, that's a whole different database.Uh and it's own. So we use that and then E BX and you know that's an Oracle application, so.Yep, all of that.All of those."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Umm.It's sufficient for maintaining the 7097 the data, because it's basically tables. I have a few queries in there, forms and stuff, but for the most part it it does what it does well for that part, the crosswalks themselves.And that didn't work too well as we kept getting more and more updates. So for instance, you know, each one of those databases runs about 45 macros."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Well, the minute that you turn around, you know Jay six is pushing out an update that disables macros or they want this stuff pushed to the portal. Well, you can't run databases off of the portal or have shared access. So you know, cloud migration, you know that that throws a crimp in our in our stuff and J 6 is not very good about communicating.Umm, what is going to happen and when it's going to happen and what the ramifications of these moves are?Umm.And so like, we just dealt with the fact that.You know, everybody had to move to the cloud and off of shared drives right? By what date was that? May, June. This year, everybody goes to the cloud, right? Well.Nobody thinks that. Ohh you can't run shared access databases in the cloud. So we have a problem. We can't shut down all of our shared drives because they don't work.So you know that causes us some grief, but other than that the the application itself works good for the most part for the 7097, unless somebody breaks it for us."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I would say that Doug and I probably are and then you know, we got a new dude, Jared, he's on our team, he's getting there.Umm."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",For access.
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",All.
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I I think sequel and Excel would be good, but I I don't know about access. The sooner I can get not using access the happier I will be."
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Not using access so I I think it does what it does really well, but there's many things that do it better so.Yeah, I think people are using access because that's what they've known.And that's what works. The transition to something else is big. That's what we're finding out now, moving to.Moving ourselves to advana, that's certainly gonna make things.Better, but I don't know that we would have been able to do that on our own without like some outside help or some knowledge that we didn't have.So."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",You know.
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","But yes, SQL and Excel it's always good to to do that that that I think that's one of the places where.As.I'll just go with software as an organization. I think that sometimes.Umm.We aren't.Are are users could be better?At understanding how the systems their systems work, like just using Excel making visualizations, we have a BI tool that we have on the zipper that.Umm, I think it's it's a very it's user friendly but.I think some people don't want to use it.So I think that's just a if we just had a a higher level of.Uh expertise as a whole in that it would make it easier for people to actually analyze stuff, do the analytics, find that information from the data versus trying to chew that data up.To get something out of it."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Mm-hmm.Yeah. And the other, the other limitation that we have too is you know we would move this stuff to a little bit more robust to a tool. There is none available on Nipper and we have to have this stuff on Nipper because it's fed to other nipper systems. So default doesn't have zipper to store, you know, or publish our data and the US this library is on Nipper as well. So we've tried to move this stuff into different database.Have solutions, but there are none available to us on Nipper."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",So that's our other limitation.
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",No.Now there's nothing.
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Well, we haven't really moved anything into data bricks yet. We were we're working on that now.The process of.The process is very laborious.Umm. And the fact that I don't think that people quite understand that anytime you move data you need to check that data.So you know, part of our issue and what we're going through with moving all of these systems into advana is that you know there's there's these documents that say, OK, well, we have this, this data element. We move this data element to here the frequency.Of the validity and the reconciliation of the data, I don't believe was actually being done by really anyone in a robust way until we decided to use advana for financial data.And it's one of the things, you know, I talked to John Ballock about all the time.Is that don't trust anything that has been moved.So I think that that's everybody wants to, you know use that Botta. It's so sexy. It's so pretty, you know, everything you know is like, did you check that the data is actually right or that it was move properly or the proper data elements were moved. So that has been very challenging for us, is to dig back through, validate the data that's in advana to the source that's probably.Probably one of our biggest biggest issues and then you know, nobody wants to be called out. Ohh. By the way, you're missing this data element or it's wrong or sometimes it's wrong all the way back to the services the services aren't using it properly. So then you have data quality issues so identifying those things.You know, this process is a very challenging and it, but I think that it's eye opening for a lot of people, you know, even in the CDO world it's like.Umm.Don't trust everything that's in there just because it's in advana.Yeah, they say that it's there because somebody's gonna call you out if you don't. If you, if it, if you don't know that, it's absolutely correct.No."
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, I I would. I would agree with.Umm.I agree with that. I think advana it has the I I think the experience moving our stuff into Vaughn has been has been really good. We've been able to learn a lot and we've been able to.Uh. Kind of get into the data, see where some of the mistakes are. But I I think when people hear the word advana, they just think and then say something is in advana that they think ohh the data everything's good and to to best point.Just because you dumped the data in there doesn't mean it's good.Come. It's sometimes. Sometimes it's just a big junkyard and you gotta go through and you gotta pick through and find the right stuff.Umm like I know just in the weekly we sent with the vice. They're talking about some medical stuff that they're pulling out of the system for SOCOM and it's populated in advana like they have a display at dashboard in Havana, but they don't have an interface of any of these systems yet. So there's data in Hive on, it's populated manually. So I think leadership, when they hear it vonna or see Ivana.They ooh, this this sexy new tool. Look at all this cool stuff I can do with it, and we can do it, but we just need to make sure our data is correct and it's been reconciled in a way that actually allows us to tell the story versus just having a bunch of stuff in there and it doesn't connect like it's supposed to. I I saw that on one of the questions, something about, I don't know which one it was, but.You know how leadership could help.Or.Hinder. I don't didn't say Tinder, but I thought sometimes leadership hinders."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Umm.
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Umm, just because I see it, they see advana like ohh this is awesome and and going through this with the vice on our stuff has been good because I think he.He was under the impression, I think maybe at some point that, hey, everything was Ivan. Everything is good and that as we've been walking him through our process, OK, he understands it, he sees the potential, we'd be able to show him, hey, this is what we can do.It's just that the stuff that we're doing, we're not to that point yet. So I think that's been helpful to help kind of.You know, expectation management on on some of this stuff?And seeing some of the the sausage making that goes on behind the scenes to know that it's not as easy as you know. Ohh I just want. I'm just gonna. I'm just gonna drill down. Just let me drill down.So you know you can't. You can't drill down if there's nothing connected, so.I'll stop."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yep.
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",What?
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yep.
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","So yeah, 100% you can make we want to, you can go in there bonnet right now and make dashboards all day. You have to bring. You may have to bring the data in in your own data set.Umm. And then populate it that way. But just because, yeah, you can do that. It just may not be the real source data from the source system.Umm, because?At the best point.We're we're finding as we go through the these services systems, we're finding mistakes. They're not just our mistakes and our data, they're mistakes and all of their forces, data or all of the armies data or wherever. So it's there's some, I mean, they may not be huge mistakes, but they are mistakes because nobody's went through the data with a comb because it's it's just an environment now. So it's good, right."
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Umm. So yeah, I think leadership, leadership, understanding that and.You know, maybe they don't need to know. Well, the device does like to get in the weeds, but not everybody likes to get in the weeds as much as he does.Umm. So just understanding that you know it.It isn't as if it isn't it easy button. There's no easy button on this stuff."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. And you know the the misconception of belief. Ohh it's there. So it's absolutely correct.Umm, not if nobody, not if nobody did due diligence to check to see if it's correct. So I think everybody wants a tool like this, but they're not really willing or don't even know in some cases.Do I need a check this stuff you know?They they they're just completely oblivious. You know, a lot of these dashboards, this data normalization that we that we're doing.That's exactly right. It's it's fixing it across the services. Ohh SOCOM, little Tiny SOCOM is finding these data quality issues.So you know, you could have a, you know, somebody at the congressional level looking at this data, and nobody's checked it.So we don't need to help on that front. We need people to to stop. So like we're we've been working on this for close to two years. It'll be two years in March and.It's, uh, it's it's, it's tough. And so you know, when you're pressured and pushed to make it make it so make it, you know, be done tomorrow.It's not going to be done tomorrow, so I'm gonna be done till it's right in this validated. So I think that's probably our biggest complaint is that it'll be done when it's right and it's valid because the minute that somebody goes in there and looks at it and it's not, the entire system loses credibility without people even blinking. So that's that's the scary part about about this stuff. Is that the minute that it gets out that a lot of this stuff is wrong or hasn't been validated.Nobody's gonna use it cause it's nobody will trust it, so you gotta be really careful."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",I'll get off my soapbox.
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Well, I mean, not all of this is in our control, right? So if there is a data quality issue that we identify, we go back to OSD Comptroller and we say, OK, the Navy isn't populating this field the way that they're supposed to in their system.And then we use, you know, OSD here Ivana as the the conduit to push the data quality.Fix because little tiny SOCOM isn't gonna change the the Navy, right? The navy's gonna say you are a you know, you're a pimple. Will get to that when we get to it. But if we identified it as a data quality issue, we need some big, bigger dogs to to go out to the service to fix it. So I think that that's like a new process that's not yet.Ohm refined if you will. So there is no, you know belly button to fix this stuff cause it's not, it's not all the same fixes and it's not something that's SOCOM has control over.And so it's been very tough. I think that what we're doing.We don't have necessarily a manpower, you know, shortage to do this, but honestly, nobody's ever done anything like this before so.We just don't know what what's gonna when that door opens, what we're gonna find. So that's part of the. The issue is is the unknowns because you know we you make assumptions and then all of a sudden you're blasted with cold air.So I don't know that it's under Socom's control."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, could be a frequency issue. Could be a data quality issue. It could be, you know, a security issue. It could be, you know, all all types of things. You know, my first.Uh, you know, discussion about moving all of our data into Sparta is because we don't want the whole world to have access to collective SOCOM financial data. It may not be classified, but it's certainly sensitive. So you know. But so it's like, alright, who do I talk to about, you know, making sure that we don't have those types of issues or that we have user access.Controls. You know those types of things, because nobody's ever done that type of thing before. So at you guys have because you're putting sensitive information now into advana.But for us that was a ohh don't forget about security, you know. So yeah, it's one of those things. We just kind of gotta learn as we we trudge through this."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Umm.
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",I would.
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Go ahead, Doug."
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Well, then I I would just say just kind of what we've we've talked about is just making sure that.Just make sure your dad is good. You already know.You're probably already using data from a source system, so comparing what is in that system to what is in advana and then the Advanta team at least that.The team that we've been working with at Ivana.Uh and OSD have been extremely helpful.And we've and when we're in constant communication with those guys on a lot of things.Umm, so I think that.That relationship has certainly helped a lot where they're almost there to the point where they they understand our data as well and almost with the data is used for. So it it makes it a lot easier when you kind of have that, that partnership or kind of symbiotic relationship where you guys know exactly.You kind of understand where.Umm. Kind of what the system can do and what the data we need.To make it do that so.Yeah, I would you say that.Overall, just having a good relationship with people that are smarter than you over."
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yeah.
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, I think from a CDO perspective though, you know as as we go through a lot of this stuff.There could be a checklist of sorts you know, developed for a so-called mandard, right?Where is the not just a.Are you guys doing the data?Umm.What's that library or whatever called Nick that you're working on the?"
"Ziebert, Nicholas K CTR USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","A colleague, calibra. Yeah, they're catalog."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","If that data catalog right? But it's like, what do you what do you put in the data catalog and the, you know, the same thing that, you know, I've kind of told John since we began this stuff. So it's like, where's where is the authoritative source? Is that listed somewhere? Because a lot of people don't know that there's authoritative sources, right. If I have the authoritative source to my Social Security numbers, obviously the Social Security Administration.But that Social Security number is located on bank accounts and pay documents and all kinds of stuff. But if the Social Security Administration changes my Social Security, or you know, name, I have to change it and all those other touch points. So I I don't. I think that that kind of gets overlooked is that if it, if you're sort, if you have a data source, that source has to be an authoritative data source and people need to know about that.Authoritative data source and then the other thing is, is that you know to have a some type of of a.You know, checklist or oversight to, you know, we just don't pile stuff into the avanna garbage dump.Is it what controls are in place to make sure that you know users you know are aren't in there? That shouldn't be, or that you know that this X amount of data is moved? You know, you know, is it sensitive? Isn't it sensitive, that type of thing? I think you know, you probably need to get some some controls over that if nobody's thinking about that yet because.Everybody wants to say about it the new buzzword, but.You gotta you gotta be careful what you put in there. And then what? You're exposing us to cause that is a nipper system, easily hacked and you know, you gotta think about about that kind of thing whenever you move anything into a single warehouse.No.That's what I got for that."
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, he did not. He didn't come through on my speakers."
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, I agree with that."
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yep.
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Your intent is to do this for all of the. I'm just gonna say I'll say J codes or centers you're gonna show to work, work through that stuff."
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, I was gonna say that's a lot of people."
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. No, I think these are good questions. And I think that.I think they're kind of getting an understanding of we may be different in sofam cause.We we have lots of data that we use all the time that a lot of other people rely on.Uh, and there's probably a few other J codes that do, or offices that do something similar, but maybe SOCOM as a whole doesn't.Umm, isn't aware that this stuff is out there. Or yeah, I think it would be good for the enterprise to get a better understanding of Advana house. So come once they use it, how SOCOM is expecting to use it and how?You know all these different units and organizations kind of fit into that picture.So good luck on all of this."
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",And I didn't. We didn't mean to live out Nick. Nick is our.Newly newly hired couple months right data steward so it.
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Couple weeks.
"Ziebert, Nicholas K CTR USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yep.
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Couple weeks. He's gonna be doing all that smart stuff that we don't understand, so.All the all our cool coating and.He knows his way around the database and stuff, so we're excited to have him on part of the team as one of the data stewards, data stewards, data scientist, whatever we call. So I didn't give him an opportunity to say anything if he has anything to say before we.What we call it."
"Ziebert, Nicholas K CTR USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, I'm just. I would consider myself a technical data Stewart. And so my mind is sort of the data governance perspective and I'm still trying to learn what the data governance you know, data governments.Is gonna be moving forward, so that's where mine is at right now."
"Rose, Samuel D CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Cool. Thank you.
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Alright, thanks."
"Ziebert, Nicholas K CTR USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",I see you guys. Thanks.
"Cesna, Bethany A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Umm.
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",No.
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, yeah, I've been here. Ohh about 15 years and I'm the lead systems accountant. Well, now the only systems accountant.I.Yeah, I work with all the accounting systems DoD wide, virtually. If there's actually 12 of them that we use."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yes, and they're all merged together in what's called DC, DC W That's old Cognos system that we're in the process of replacing with advana."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Uh, yes, yes. Our our goal is 1 April.We're hoping to make make that goal, but yeah, did the CDC W is old it antiquated, but it's all we have right now and all of our budget analysts you can imagine.You going out to 12 different accounting systems every time somebody had a question about our execution would be impossible. So this brings it all. All the systems together into one spot that it can do a global query and and seeing an instant exactly what use of sock is spending versus AFSOC versus navsoc.And not have to run around to all the different systems."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yet yeah, DC, DC W yes, we can do that currently."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Uh, yeah, initially we're just trying to duplicate the the capabilities, but yeah, we'll be able to do much more.Going forward.You know that I don't know if you're familiar with Cognos, but it's it's it's.Old and.It's almost like the DOS versus Windows as you know.It's over."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Right, exactly. Yeah. It was a first designed in the late 90s, early 2000s when it first.Came on board."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Well, probably probably the big thing is.To get things changed in Cognos took you know an SCR and took months and months and months to get through where what we're able to do in advana is, you know, pretty much change things on the fly.Yeah. What I've been able it. It took a team of probably 30 people five years to create the Cognos environment 20 years ago. And we're doing it advana. I've been working on it well.So yeah, pretty much solidly over the last two years, I kind of.We dipped our toes in at five years ago, discovered a bunch of things missing, and advana pointed out what we saw that need to be fixed and.And the Advanta team went back to the drawing board and did some fixes. We'd look at it again and say now you still need to do this. And finally, in December 2019, it looked like there was enough pieces of the puzzle there to start putting it together, and we've been working on that ever since. And it's really been just me. And initially it was just me.And some folks are already ammo and then.I guess the money came through last September.And Advana hired a developer.And then about last March, they hired a data engineer for us.And we recently got assigned a data steward so the team is coming together and we're we're moving right along.Over."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yes, that's true."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Ohh yeah, yeah, it's it's it's moving really fast and speeding up every day.But we still find a find issues with the data that we have to go back and fix.OK, I kind of describe advana as a data junkyard that nobody's gone through and cleaned up. They just kind of dumped the data in there."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yep.
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","OK, I I I'm not sure if I understand the question. Are you talking about action? Observe, decide, Orient or are you talking about?You know, analyzed before aggregate etcetera."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","OK, I guess.Primarily, I'd be at the analyze.Uh.Actually, the top three aggregate report and analyze.Because what we're that's what we're doing, we're aggregating, you know.The 12 accounting systems.And then doing reports and analyzing the data."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Well, yeah, see, we're not really at that point, OK, my, my report, it's not really a report. I do queries in the database and I do reconciliations to make sure that the data is accurate. So I'll take the data in advance and run a query and then match it up with, say, the D 1002 report that OSD produces. And make sure that.Advana is.Reporting the same numbers, and if there's if there's an error, then I have to kind of peel back the onion and determine, OK, is it an army, Air Force, Navy or marine problem? Then once I determine that, then I have to say it's.Air Force. Then there's two Air Force accounting systems I have to eliminate, you know. Is it is it the old gap system or is it deems and I just kind of keep peeling back the onion until I figure out where the problem lies and then figure out a solution to fix it.Uh, as far as the other people?Once I I I could verify that, yeah, the system's good to use that other people are doing the reports and making decisions based on the information."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Over.
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. No, I do uh reconciliations every month. So even on the DC, DC W, we have 146 appropriations. So at the end of every month, I would compare those 146 appropriations and run queries in the DCDC, we compare it to to the 1002 reports and just repeat that process every month."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Right. And so in advana, that's what we'll be automating. So that was one of the things old Cognos it was.Couldn't find anybody like make that magic happen, but we can do that at avana. So going forward right now I'm testing the data initially, but once it's everything passes inspection and it's all put together, we'll do the reconciliation with the 1002.Uh automatically in advance will be just a report. Someone who look at once a month and say, oh Yep, everything's good green light.If there is a problem, it'll flash red and then someone will have to dig in and and analyze what what went wrong."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",It's going to eliminate my job entirely.
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",That's.
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","That's OK. Yeah. I I have 42 years civil service, so.Uh, I I'm really retire."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Actually defensive designed to they own the DC DC W yeah, DFAS, Indianapolis.Also, I there's reports that we get.If a transaction has the wrong accounting data, it'll suspend so you know I get those reports now and I have to go through try to figure out, you know, what went what went wrong and fix it.In Advanta, we won't have that problem. Everything will flow into advana and we'll get a report if there's something.Is a miss like there's a mapping error.We're we're building that into the advanta capabilities.So we're eliminating a lot of manual work that DCW required.Over."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Sure.So and the DC DC W side, it's Cognos. I can export reports in in Excel or CSV that I bring them into Microsoft Access and.Then use Excel pulls pulls the data into Excel that creates pivot tables so I can do my reconciliations.Uh, with advana I'm using.Click and as we're developing things and I'm using inquery when I need to pull raw data and doing the same thing, pulling it into access.Our into excel via access, uh to do my comparisons analysis.Over."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Uh, no, it's just self-taught. Learn, learn as I go.I'm kind of like a trailblazer in this. This is all.You know, carving a new path."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yeah.
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","It's.Kind of needs based as I come across something, but the Advanta team was here last March and did a week of some training and introduction and they were here again, my team.My my programmer that that was assigned and some other folks from Advana they were here what two weeks ago and we spent a week at Softworks and going through mapping and and training and learning.Uh, but, but pretty much it's been as I come across things I have people I can reach out to and say hey, you know, I know I know some SQL but I don't know. I'm not a programmer.Yeah. So there'll be some things it's like, well, how do I, you know, what's the syntax for this? I need to do this. And you know, the the programmer guys will just give me a call back and say, oh, yeah, just put this in there. Right. OK.So just trial and error over."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, it's been, it's been working good."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, it's, you know, so I'm in accounting.But RDML resource data management office, they're the they're the the coders for the accounting system. So we've been working together.Just kind of a joint effort. There's some some, you know, I worry about the data accuracy.And the underlying database and they do actually do the coding. And what telling you Sock and AFSOC and NAVSOC and publishing.Uh manuals on what codes to use under what circumstances? So when you bring it all together?That it's it's. I guess it's kind of almost like an orchestra, you know? Yeah. What makes might make sure everybody's got the same sheet of music.Even though we're playing a different instrument.Them."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, it's, it's. It's really a bizarre world. It doesn't exist anywhere else in DoD. Uh, when you talk about these 12 accounting systems, think of 12 different foreign languages and.And no one here can speak any of those languages, so he has to be. They all have to be translated into a common sophomore language.Over."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, I'm gonna probably the few people that speak all 12 languages."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Right, it's it's there's several layers.Yeah, we have our weekly local meeting. You know our staff meeting.And then there was monthly meetings that were going up to senior leadership, but now that's accelerated. We got the vice commander. I guess we're doing.Our goal is, I think, weekly or every other week now, so it's it's.You know, is it initially started out a couple years ago, you know, it was longer time periods between meetings, but it's things started accelerating.You know, I've I've a meeting on on like this afternoon with my development team just to set the goals and the priorities for this week and then we'll meet with the DFAS team on Thursday and.Yeah, I'll cover what's been accomplished type of thing. And then there's the senior leader meetings that we brief usually every other week.Over."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Ohh yes very.
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Right.Yeah. We have a couple different matrices we're using. We have issue tracker that as we discover discrepancies and and things that need to be fixed we we document that that's in advana and available for the whole team to see.Yeah. And we have another chart that we use to show you know where we are with each of the systems and it's color-coded and showing you know.Yeah, you know, green, if it's, if it's accomplished and yellow if it's got some minor errors and blank if we haven't even gotten there yet.Kind of like a flow chart, I guess in a."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","But right, it's it's really fluid because what we don't know what we don't know. So you know, we discovered things. For instance, we discovered in the Air Force theme system all the advanta data between FY16 to FY19 had holes in the data. There were fields that should have been populated that weren't and quite a few of them. But it wasn't consistent. So the Air Force had to, we had to reingest all the data.Well, that that process took about nine months and we didn't know we were gonna even have that problem, you know? So there's most everything has been.We we don't know what surprise we're gonna discover tomorrow. So it's it's it's it's a moving target."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Right. Yeah. So yeah, our goal is to have the, the, the data accuracy at at least 99% accurate.Yeah, when you have and still that's a big number when you have a, you know, a a $7 billion budget, you know 99% is.Now the the the the variance is still a big number so."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","And it's like I said, it's constantly moving. So you, you know, you fix what you can at the end of this month and I.You know, I'm not. I'm just finishing them up all of my end of September. Reconciliations and adjustments and.Late next week, I'll be starting on the October."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Ohh and the the DC DC W side is definitely a a 99 plus percent uh.And that advantage side.Yeah, it's kind of hard to put a percentage because we'll do it in, in pieces.UH-1 system at a time.So yeah, and we have a couple of issues ongoing now that we found out that we have to go back to the service and see if they can reingest the data because again, we found some holes.And then that's why you use affectionately use the data junkyard because they dumped the data in there, but they didn't have anybody that really knew what they were looking for to determine.If there was anything missing."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","It takes it takes a geek like me to that, that.I dive into these things all all day long and I can just look at a field and go. There's supposed something supposed to be in there. That's not an optional field and.Type of thing."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Right, right.Right. And since I'm familiar with the data it's, you know, I know exactly what it means I.Or.Yeah, to the programmers. It's just numbers in a field."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Uh, no. And the accounting side of the only person, but I DMO that they speak the language, all 12 languages themselves. So there's my wife, that's Cessna, she's in charge of the team there. There's Doug Rose, Jared.So I think there's there's.I think there's four people over there.So yeah, you know, if it's that they don't care so much about the numbers, they could they they concentrate on the structure."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",And I make sure that that that the the dollars and the numbers are accurate.That's kind of a joint thing.
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Well, it actually when SOCOM first was born in their little itty bitty.You know, they didn't. There wasn't that many people, even in special operations. I mean, and as far as the enterprise. So yeah, the individual analysts just pulling their their reports, their army reports and their Air Force reports from the native accounting systems. But as we started growing, it became real obvious that that wasn't going to work. So A-Team was put together back in the late 90s.Uh.To create the DCD DCW.And.They they.They messed it up initially, which isn't surprising and is a bit huge tasking and.The then CFO used to work with my my wife. She wasn't my wife back then, but she got pulled in on special duties assignment. She was active duty as a tech Sergeant Air Force got.Pulled in from Tyndall Air Force Base to here to straighten out this mess.And uh, she's been here ever since she straightened it all out, reorganized it, got the data she had to. She had to learn.By yourself, though the different languages.Now, just through the school of Hard Knocks and.And it just grew from there.Over."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Oh yeah, sure. Already MO has that documented all of this. It's huge. Lots of lab documents and they're, you know, there's at least, like I said, three or four people there. So and Doug's been there for a while, so they've got some, some overlap and.Even though I'm the only one in accounting working this, we have an army command accountant and the Air Force Command accountant and Navy Command accountant. So we have people in accounting that know.Their own service systems so.Yeah, I might be the only one that knows all of them. And I'm not a I'm not, you know, an expert in all of them. I know enough to do what I need to do.The command accounts are the experts, so when I even when I runned it something into something that's kind of.Out of the ordinary, I can go to my Air Force Command account, for instance, and say, hey, could you take a look at this, this little screwed up?But for the most part, the command accounts are focused on audit and they got other duties. So that's the one nice thing is I don't have to worry about audit. I'm not involved in that piece of the world at all.I'm my customer's really basically the budget analyst. Those are my end customers.They need to make the they they rely on me to make sure that when they pull up, they're pulling reports out of DC, DC, W or advana that the numbers that they.The reports they're producing are accurate.Over."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yes. During the soflam egg.Yeah.
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. You're gonna be speaking with Larry Arnold, I think.Later today or tomorrow. But yeah, then he's the Air Force Command account.And our Navy Command accountant is.A vacant right now we have a person filling in and our army command account and just came on board.Uh, yes. Couple of weeks ago."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, they actually have access to the Cognos cubes, which is kind of like a, you know, a pivot table.Similar to pivot table structure, uh. And they also the DC DC W does a sipper feed each night, so there's reports on the zipper side that are canned and just get updated automatically that the budget analysts use.We have programmers on the uh, uh, sofam, M side that built all that and maintain it."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, probably. Repacked, it's it. It it changes part of its analytics. You know there they have seasonal type things going on. So I think right now they're in a budget formulation for FY23. So they might be looking at historical data and trends in the data to come up with their bogeys for next fiscal year. So they're.Yeah. So that's budget formulation. Yet later in the year.Uh, probably. In January, February they can start looking at current year execution. Right now we're on a continuing resolution. So there isn't a whole lot to look at.You know, everybody's just kind of treading water, but by end of March, OSD requires us to be 50% obligated if we're not.You know that's halfway through the fiscal year. They start raising questions and threatening to take your money away. So your budget analysts are are really keen in March at looking at that across the enterprise and making sure AFSOC executing, they're gonna make it to their 50% and same with apps navsoc and the T socks.You have a congressionally mandated you have to be obligated 80% obligated by.Was it end to July?Otherwise, Congress threatens to take your money, so there's there's there's different things you're using the data for depending on the time of year.Over."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Sure. Sure. It's yeah. And that's one thing scary with advana is, OSD, when this is.We're actually the prototype of if.Well, we will be successful, but OSD is gonna pretty much copy paste so Coms what we're doing for SOCOM and do it.Replicate what we did. DoD Y so they can have a bird's eye view and and a deep.Detail view of everything that's going on in DoD."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",As right now that they're they only have the capability of looking at things from a very broad stroke.And any detailed questions they have to do data calls.Yeah.
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","And it's a game of liars. Poker too, to be quite honest, it always has been.Yeah."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Right. Yeah. So that's I and you know, some of that wires poker, there's good reason for that so.I don't know. There's there's. I have some concerns if. If.You know.Mom and Dad know too much. They may make some assumptions that could mess things up, but we'll see.Exactly."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yep.But that's the big the big thing with big data now, everybody's gonna have access to all the intricate.Pieces of the puzzle."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yeah.
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, verify everything.Don't make any assumptions."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Right. Yeah. I always go back to the source and compare.Regardless whether it's, it's just not just financial data. It could be. Yeah, my experience.Every anytime you you copy paste or or move data from one place to another you you.You're going to lose data, you're.Something always happens."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Not as far as what my what I'm doing with Ivan and the DC DC W now it's just.Just me at this point there, there were there were three of us at one time, many, many moons ago.Uh, but unfortunately, when when things are running smooth and management is is looking to slim down?Uh personnel, they kind of rolled up some duties. So technically my my the command accounts are supposed to be helping me but.They're so overwhelmed with with audit.Down the.They do what they can, but they they're they're plates are full.Yeah, it's just.Yell and the DC DW, like I said, for for a few years there, everything was running really smooth, but then the Air Force migrated from gas to deems the army migrated from Stan friends and Somarts into Gfebs. The Navy was doing the same thing. And then fortunately, when they migrated to all these new systems.They fought. They discovered that certain things they couldn't migrate. So you still have the old systems running concurrently with the new systems. You know, we shouldn't have.You know, three army accounting system, actually 4 army accounting systems running simultaneously. That was never part of the Army's plan, but that's what it ended up being.I think my personal opinion, we waited too long to do these upgrades. Most of the the legacy systems were were designed and built in the 60s and there's nobody still alive that it actually even knows how they're put together. And that's what makes it really tough to migrate to a new system when you don't really know how the old system works.Over."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Uh, not much. We just have to.Yeah, yeah.React to what they're doing. I mean, we're, we're.For a small customer they you know, big Army doesn't care about us. They get enough problems with their own and I don't really blame them. And Air Force and the Navy's the same way. Yeah, we just have to.React to what?What they're doing?The Air Force has been trying to replace their supply system for the last.Ohh over a decade that I'm aware of.And the the first, the first attempt failed.And they're on their second attempt. Now the Navy ERP system there, that that was a total disaster.Yeah, they're still trying to figure that one out, so."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Ohh no.That's for sure.
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, that's really not in my wheelhouse. That would be my wife.She she attends all those meetings and all the strategic planning for the for the future. I'm, I'm.We're dealing with.The now."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Uh.Yeah. And I think there's a plan going forward we've got.Nick is our.The data steward that recently was assigned the soft from M and he'll be doing. He's starting to work with us on the advanta thing, so he'll basically.When I'm gone, you know, you know, he'll keep things going.And that all the pieces there and and we we talked about this a little bit I guess you know the CDO office, you have engineers and data scientists. And so if there's something that's beyond Nicks capability, he would probably seek some help from a data engineer in the CDOs office. And if they couldn't figure it out, then we'd go to advana at OSD and.I at least that's how that's the vision we're currently seeing. Is that how you see it?"
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Right, right. Yeah. Because like I said, I have a developer that was assigned by OSD. I guess we sent them like, $1.2 million to Vanna, I think last September and.Like the data engineer we've had, she's working some projects, but once those are done, once all 11 or 12 systems are are are fed in there, her job will be done and they'll reassign her to something else. And the same thing with our developer. Once everything's developed up and running and it's just a maintenance thing, we'll be able to maintain it ourselves with the help of our data steward. If there's anything you know that's.But we don't.I I think at some point we're just.We won't need much in the way of programmers type. You know the counts will be able to take it from there and and uh.Just run with it."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Right. Well, in, in a prior life, I was a budget analyst, so that's that's actually helping me in this sense that.I know what a budget analyst has to do cause I've done it, so I'm I'm.We're giving them every field they could possibly ever want, and it's already been.Uh. Translated into common English. You're not gonna have to know what the code for use of sock is. It'll tell you just drag the organization field into your.Add to your your desktop and it'll give you. It'll say usasoc afsoc. You wanna drill down to the next lower level. It'll tell you you know whether it's the 1st Special Operations Wing or.Everything's gonna be in plain language. It'll it'll say Sif pay. And here's your obligations. It'll say supplies so you won't have to know any of the codes behind it. Everything will be translated.It it'll be a dashboard, you know that everybody from the, the, the the budget analyst all the way up to the the commander will understand exactly what they what they're looking at."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Right. But down the road, if, if if the army.Sides to get go to another system again 10 years from now. We'll then then we'll have to go back and that'll be have to be ingested into advana. It'll have to be coded and.You know, so system changes will will definitely have an impact, but other than that?"
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Well, yeah, sure. The the, the, the, the services themselves dictate the rules in their accounting systems.So.Try to give you.If if you're an AFSOC or you're a Ranger."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Uh, you know, soldier, that you're in special operations. Chances are, unless you're a senior level person, you don't even know SOCOM exists. You're just army. You know your Air Force. You know, I didn't know. So comma existed until.For for years."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. So.So yeah, the, you know, we don't dictate to them. They don't even know exist. Most of them. And you know they they grew up Air Force, they grew up army. They go to their schools, they get their regulations. That's all covered on what they do now.The one difference is my wife does the structuring in.As far as coding and that gets published and and sent out to the components, what's actually on our?On our Internet and all the comptrollers know that they need to go in there and that's that's their their Bible on which codes to use for which.What? What type of events?For instance, there's program element codes, so there's a program element code for H60 helicopters. There's a program element code for.Uh.8C130 gunships.There's program codes for Intel. There's for for almost everything you can imagine. There are codes for it and the and the people at AFSOC and used to talk that are executing their budget.They use those manuals to be able to fill out the data elements.You know, in accordance with so when it all comes together in, in, in our reports."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","You know it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We have special interest codes for say.Hurricanes.So we buy used to suck might be involved. Afsoc might be involved in in in some aspect of uh hurricane.Support and that data will be coded and when we pull it all together in our application will be able to see OK yeah, we SOCOM as a whole is spent X number of dollars in support of.This hurricane, or this exercise or this deployment.Uh, Ukraine, for instance. You know, everybody's involved in Ukraine. It's once you say one one way or another and all all those costs have to be captured. And there's a code that's input into the accounting systems for anything you crane related."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Right. Yeah, that's stuff from M does all that work."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",There be. Yeah. Trivia. Cole. I think you're. You're speaking. You think she's on your list to talk to? She's in charge of that section.
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, there was an issue. For instance with some margin Stanfield's data coming from the army. The army didn't want it in Advana for security purposes, we needed it.Because it's a piece of big piece of the puzzle. So we had sophanem that office sat down and figured out which which fields that they could safely bring into the database excluding other fields. So it didn't.We didn't compromise any security."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Right. And and army created Gfebs SA for all the.Other classified accounting and that's all on the zipper side, but the army does.Send a declassified summarized version on the Nipper side, so we take that nipper data and pull that into advana. But the but it's all been scrubbed and it's diluted, if you will.Over."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Ohh good.Yeah, the the, the Army command accountant transferred.The Navy Command accountant retired.Uh, so?Yeah, our retentions.Been really good. It's just I think we're getting old."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yeah.
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Ohh yeah, I could have retired five years ago, but my wife wouldn't let me, she said. She said we have to finish this advana thing first."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",But.
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, I think we're going down the right path. I I'm kind of really excited about.The way we're we're we're heading. I wish it would. We would have been going this way.Well, 10 years ago.Over."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, I don't think I have any questions at this point. Thanks."
"Cesna, Leonard N CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",You too have a good one.
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",I have none this trivia.
"Anderson-Moore, Erma A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",And then here.
"Sablan, Priscilla A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",No.
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","OK, I'll start. I'm trivia cold. I've been here for four years now here in Southam.Umm, the team so I am the chief of this section of systems integration. You interviewed my boss earlier this morning, Mr Shapiro.Or within the integrate the Systems integration division.We actually have several sections under here, so I have what we call our.Development team, which consists of contractors who manage and maintain.I'll so comes financial system, which is called the P business planning programming.Budgeting execution management information system, that's what that means. So those those contractors are maintain that system. Then we also have what we call the Code management section.And cold management, what they are responsible for is.Umm the If you will the the cross referencing the codes and the data elements from our services systems into what we would call SOCOM language and speak. That's a a simple ride way of putting it. Then we have the financial management supports section which is where Irma and Priscilla actually worked and what they're responsible for is.The palm and budget submissions that SOCOM submit that goes up to OSD. We have to make sure that that information is accurate and correct within the OSD databases. They are pretty much like the liaisons, if you will, between the SOCOM users who are submitting department budgets and then.Uh. With the uh communications with OSD?Umm well, we have the uh the the support there.Umm. And then the last last section that's here is what we call the IT support system. So within internal to solve them we have our own IT support who helps us manage the day-to-day if we have any.Any problems with our systems and ensure that our systems are compliance with the upgrades so they are they pretty much lays on with J6J6 is responsible for that. But these guys are in close communication and contact with J6 on a daily and routine basis of if there's something that they can fix at that level then they provide the support directly to solve them. If not then they facilitate, you know trouble tickets and.I'm with this uh, corresponding with J6 to get our IT issues fixed over."
"Anderson-Moore, Erma A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","OK, sure.I've been here for approximately 23 years in, in so off of I've worked and I think for the different directorates I was here on active duty, retired came back a few years. I mean a few months later and started back in OM then worked over in RDT and E and investments and where I'm at now in systems integration when I was on active do that work in headquarters budget which now falls under the the Chief of staff.But when I was when I did, we fell on the sofa.So I've done, uh, primarily budget.Umm, the whole time I've been here in the I've been here in system integration since about 2011 so.Over."
"Sablan, Priscilla A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Uh, yeah, I started in code management in 2006 and I've been there ever since till 2021 when I I was a contractor over there and then I transitioned over here with Irma and July of 21.Umm, so additional duties that I do is I'm a gfebs GRC provisioner for Gfebs main and the snap administrator for SOCOM.The primary POC, so I'm just still kind of trying to learn the palm in budget submission process, but I'm getting there."
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","And so this is trivial. So what we are responsible for SOCOM at large is for the palm and budget. We we have several submissions. You have the palm submission which is your program, objective memorandum submission. We also have the the budget estimation submission which is the best and then we have the President's budget submission. So those 3 submissions. So COM has to submit up to OSD on an annual basis.And what we do here is you have within Sofam BB which is sofam budget. They'll actually formulation, they'll do the budget I.Identify the the data elements and everything that needs to go into the budget and then it goes into the OSD system which is called NGRSNGRS. Stands for the next generation resource management system.Umm OSD just implemented that system this year. As a matter of fact, it combined two of the other.And financial systems that we had to put data in, they were called the cyst and PRCP. So OSD combined those. So what we do here is for those electronic submissions, Priscilla and Erma ensure that the submissions are accurate. And what I mean by that is they have to make sure that at the appropriation level, at the budget activity level, that across the board by fiscal years that we are balanced to what?OSD says that so calms total obligation. Authority should be.And when I mean laison like for a prime example right now we are in the the process of putting in our actuals, see the actuals, the FY22, what SOCOM executed for 22 and for those actuals our budget.Directorate are they're putting that information in the budget and Investment Directorate, but earn my and Priscilla, we've we've, we've come across some challenges. So what they're doing is when I said corresponding, they're talking directly to the OSD analyst to try to resolve what those issues are, what the errors are, what we need to to fix it. Right now, they're OSD area is experiencing some system glitches because they are. It is a new system. And so as we are identifying those we are having.The talking and communications with the analysts at OSD to resolve those issues to make sure that SOCOM is budget, is submitted accurately and in the correct format as prescribed by OSD over."
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Correct. So my office is the central point of contact, if you will, to ensure that our submissions are are accurate, correct."
"Anderson-Moore, Erma A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",So.
"Anderson-Moore, Erma A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","So if I can add to a trivia just said we also. So the other thing we do is when we get the guidance from OSD, uh, we usually hold meetings with the two budget directors to go through that guidance to understand to make sure that everybody's on the same sheet of music as to what has to be submitted because it does change from.From submission to submission. So in how we have to put the data in or what data they're looking for. So sometimes they're specific.A data that you're looking for, like in a particular AR you know, and it may be something that we've never done before or it may be a new category of data like they've come up with this climate category stuff. So that's the other thing that we do as well is meet with the budget directors to make sure that we're all on the same sheet of music as to what has to be done, if they're changes to the guidance. As far as the data that they have to submit into the OSD database over."
"Anderson-Moore, Erma A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Right. So we make sure that that's because like I said, the guidance can change from cycle to cycle as far as what they're looking for in specific areas. So we just try to make sure that everybody understands that, OK, this cycle, it was this, now this cycle, this is what they're looking for over."
"Anderson-Moore, Erma A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yes, it's always easy to just put it in one time. So before we had to put it in two totally different systems and the data was different that you put in cause one system, it was at a summary level and then the other system. So the systems were cysts, which is controller information system and then the other one was PRCP which was a.Program resource collection process.Sis was at the at a much higher level. The appropriation budget activity and SPC code, whereas PRCP was at a much lower level detail, it was the appropriation the BA projects.Uh SPC code. A whole bunch of other data fields that you had to submit, whereas now you put it all in one and it's there, they have it all.So it's easier. I mean once we get through all the glitches that they have it, it'll be a much better process over."
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. Also Jessica, if I can add to that, we within our office, not only do we have the electronic submissions, then you also have what we call the exhibits. The exhibits are done in a separate system, which is called snap and crumble will have to kind of refresh my memory with SNAP stands for. But for the budget exhibits, what OSD will do is in the guidance will identify which exhibits have to be submitted.Throughout the different cycles, whether it's the palm budget or or the best cycle, and that's where the Scilla says she's responsible for. So she actually we get the guidance down from OSD Pasilla will send out the what we call the TMT. She'll send that out to the various.The various Jake holds and for where that we need information from, from them to put the input in for the budget exhibits. And then she makes sure that those exhibits are submitted within these within snap within the system.Umm. Within the timeline that OSD has published over."
"Anderson-Moore, Erma A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","OK, so add select is OK, it's a database that's owned by OSD Cape. The cost assessment program and Evaluation Directorate, and basically the information that goes in. So both budget directors, the investment folks who handles the multi year appropriations, proc RDT and E milcon, they do budget books.And Onim does theirs as well. Well, in addition it, but all that information is at a summary level. So what snap is, it's where a Smee with an OSD says, OK, I need additional information on X program. So what they'll do is they will put that into a PDR.And it's just instructions. OK I want.Informational audit resources. So in addition to them doing their budget book, they will also have to submit that exhibit that entails the information on what we're spending on audit resources.Right now it's about, I think, a total of between 20 and maybe 30 additional exhibits if they have to do in addition to their budget exhibits. But the thing about SNAP is it's not necessarily done by the budget director. Sometimes this information that has to come from a different J code like soft training, the onion folks don't have the details on all the various courses that soft personnel participate in. So the J5.Provide that information or they might be on a J3 now, but the training folks are the ones that provide that information for snap over."
"Anderson-Moore, Erma A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","So for snap they.They're submitted as an Excel template into OSD's database, but they come out as a as a budget. They budget exhibit in the format that OSC wants them to, and the same thing with the budget books. Their actual budget books. They're not just Excel spreadsheets."
"Anderson-Moore, Erma A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",You got it right.
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yes.
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","That uh, this is trivial. Yes, that is correct. Uh, it soft from owns and manages it, but it's it's pretty much it is a SOCOM system. It's SOCOM single.I authoritative source for our you know, for our total obligations, manpower and forces data and it's used for the the preparation and submission of our palm and budgets to OSD.Umm, actually the OSD and then OMB and Congress. So it's it's actually our automated system internals are SOCOM that we own and manage, but it's it's for all of our all of sitcoms, data and information."
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",On the data in the people business is generated in house.Right.
"Anderson-Moore, Erma A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","With the exception of the actuals for OEM that's generated from the service accounting systems, our team in the back, they will integrate those data files from the service system once the O&M budget director tells us they're ready for them to integrate it in. And then they in turn the budget analysts within O&M were going to massage and you know clean up the data as they have as they see that they have to.For actuals, but everything else like trivia said is for the palm best and PB.Everything else is generated in house.Over."
"Anderson-Moore, Erma A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","It it works fine for me because I don't. There's nothing for me really to do. We just wait for the analyst to get all their information in because, like, trivia was explaining earlier, we just finished up with doing actuals in the OSD database. So for us it's no, there's just nothing there.For our team in the back that integrates the data.They will help the budget folks clean up their data, because sometimes it's it's a lot of data and to manually input it.Takes time, so they will sometimes uh, do a script to integrate the data for them to help them clean it up, but it's not a whole lot for us with actuals on that end over."
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yeah.
"Anderson-Moore, Erma A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, where they can, we have some unique data fields within the midst that aren't in the service accounting system. So it's not as easy for some of the data where it's shared by multiple components. So yeah, it's it's, it's tougher for the OEM budget analyst than it is for us because they have to go in and then you know, figure out what goes where, where there's shared information over."
"Anderson-Moore, Erma A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, that team has been here since the inception of the Miss. It's my understanding when they built it, they.Uh had the contracts and they had to stay on to maintain it over."
"Anderson-Moore, Erma A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Ohh goddess is 20 plus years old so I don't have. Yeah it it's been around for a little bit.
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","So we are continuously developing those Umm. So any questions that you have to that particular process Jessica, I would ask you to hold them and defer. You're actually gonna have a separate section on a session with code management. I know that such that section was very integral to what SOCOM does especially for our data. So I've set up a separate section session that you're gonna have with them, I believe is tomorrow.That you actually have with that set that section and they can go into the details that section just for your situation. Awareness and knowledge just in case you have questions is the ones who are actually doing what we call our for the advana, the budget execution platform that's going to be advana and advana. So you can gain a whole lot of information and knowledge from those guys. Specifically they can get into the details, but.Yeah, they are pretty much what they're doing is they're they actually do the crosswalk. So we create and maintain our funding and execution codes and crosswalks. We do those internally. And then there's a document that they publish those in. It's called AD fast 7097. But like I said, those guys will probably be able to give you more details and information on than than I could provide."
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yes.
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Umm, just from what we've been doing, I think that once it's up and running, it's going to be a great tool that we can use here in the command, one for information sharing to where leadership will actually have visibility and access of, you know, just across the board of our budget execution, SOCOM is actually.I the only.If you will, we're the only ones right now. We're trailblazing this initiative with the budget execution bringing in the data from the service systems that SOCOM use. So we have 11 different service systems that we pull our execution data from.Umm, so uh, that's a huge, huge initiative that we are undertaking right now. Umm, we've, you know, just with anything that you're implementing the for the first time we run into some challenges but we are pretty much on.We are in what we call 5 phases, right? So right now we're in phase four and the first phase was you know actually.I OSD pulling the the advantage team pulling the data from the various service systems into the Advanta platform and then what we had to do is what we call normalize that data and do data reconciliations. So that's the process that we're kind of finishing up right now. We've pulled all the data in from the 11 systems, but we're still doing some reconciliations. There's still some data.Elements that we, you know we have to configure and things of that nature. So that's what we're doing right now. And then the next two phases will be what we call the integration and the reporting phase. And so that's what Nick the data steward is we are relying heavily upon his expertise and knowledge for us to to be able to do that. And what that means is now we have to take this data that's coming that's in the system and Ivana and put that into SOCOM speak and SOCOM language and crosswalks.The great thing about this is once we get everything in Ivana, all of the execution data, then we will no longer have to do the crosswalks because it's already in the system and standardized. We're right now. Every year when we go from from the end of the fiscal year from 1.From one fiscal year to the next for the execution, we have to do those crosswalks, those tables. That's what cold management the the. That's a continuous cycle that we would that we had to do with Ivana. We will no longer be required to do that which will be just a huge savings, manpower savings and workload if you will. So we are actually looking forward to advana and the capability that it provides and and by SOCOM doing this.We are actually.Really helping the services if you will, because when it's time for OSD to integrate the systems like bodeans for Air Force or whatever, they've already kind of cracked the code of what's required to do that. That if you will that that integration piece of that. So it it'll probably be a smoother transition because we've already done that over."
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Hey, that's that's a good one. UM, Beth, the code management team will probably be able to give you more information, but from my aspect, what what's really been.A great, I would say, best practice that we would share with others is to have internally they need to have what we call someone to help with the reconciliations. It's been a huge success for us. Having someone internally sold within our cell phone we have in the accounting division, there's one person that has been doing the integration. So as OSD Ivana has been bringing in the data.We have this one person that has been actually doing the reconciliation cross referencing with the other systems to make sure that the data is accurate and we have the correct data fields and things of that nature. So that's been a huge like I said it best practice that we've learned because I mean if you think about it, the guys that OSD they they're bringing in the data, but at the time we didn't have what we call a QC right the way you could do a quality check.Across the board. So what we were doing is we were looking at that data that's coming in against ad fast system which is called the DCW. We was reconciling against that and then also a report that comes out of that that comes from the service system. It's the 1002 report. And so Leo who was working it was doing it 3 way reconciliation. The data that was in advanta against what's was in the DCW against what's.The 1002 report to make sure that all three balanced so that was a best practice and it's been uh it's it's been huge for us over."
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Absolutely yes.
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yes. So for I would uh IT support we have two personnel that's actually doing that. So what they do is they have portal administration and development within software for. So they maintain our porters, nippers, zipper.They also do the data transfer authority when we need to have data transferred. Primarily we can do from Nipper to sipper ourselves, but from sipper to nipper then they are facilitate that to make sure that you know to prevent data spillage.Umm. And then they also for all of our equipment. And here are IT equipment. You know they are, uh equipment console deals ensuring that our equipment is properly recorded on the property books that you know as it's issued to the the personnel within solve them whenever we have any incoming personnel they ensure that.Umm, when the person's come in, you know they have the the they have a computer. They have all the excellerator equipment. You know, the telephone lines are set up the the drops are done so they facilitate all that. They don't do it themselves, but they they ensure that you know we have the.The the requested with J6 and they they're the follow up with that.And then they are also our direct support for our hardware software. So again, when we have these, you know, mass software upgrades, they're the ones that's going around to ensure that you know all our systems are updated properly. If we're having any problems and need someone to help troubleshoot, they are here on hand, you know, in the office to provide that support. And that's that's a huge, huge savings for us.Because as you're aware, you know J6 is very busy there. They're supporting the command at large, so if you call the help desk, it may be, you know, 4872 hours before they can actually get to you. And it may be simple in the end. So by having that those resources right here within sofam, it definitely helps us, you know to, to expedite things, especially when we are against up against deadlines. You know, having those resources and houses has paid.Huge dividends for us."
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Umm, I've had a couple of challenges. I've been very fortunate that I haven't had high turnover, you know, attrition I with the software Ms. But I have had a couple of positions that were vacant and had it does take a while. What I can say is so calm and FFPC have vastly improved you know the the some of the processes and the the the time to get personnel in.Uh, for example, for me, for years ago it took over 8 months for me to from the time that I was, you know, notified that I was hired for the, that I was selected for the position. It took about 8 months before I actually got orders and was able to PCs here, the SOCOM. So that timeline has reduced, but it can be challenging just with some of the processes of, you know, getting personnel in.I haven't had that in in a while, I think.I overall, I think I've had maybe two positions. Yeah, two vacancies that I had to fill in the time that I've been here. And what I mean vacancies is it's a position. But one of my positions, like literally within one year I had a let's see three different people in a year and a half. I had three different people in that same position.One person came, didn't work out, left another person came and for personal reasons, like within four months he left. So then it took me, you know, it took a while and then COVID didn't help the situation because there was no movement during COVID. So that position stated vacant until we were actually able to PCP's resume that. And and he was able to come in over."
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Umm, so for uh, supplement Ms for my uh division is the skill set for code management is very unique.Umm, so you're. I mean, bottom line, you're not gonna find anyone from you know that school trained that was in financial management for this particular section. If you work somewhere like did fast within systems, you may have had that experience. Other than that you're not going to find it. So you actually just throughout my process I'm looking for someone who understands the the PBE process who may have worked in budget.Understands the data elements and things of that nature, and then we have to actually do OJT when they get here for code management, because that's not something that you're gonna find that school trained.For the position that Armas in, it's it's kind of the same. Umm, unless you have worked at you know at the major command level at the headquarters level, you're not going to have that experience with the OSD databases directly doing your submissions, because usually it's suborganizations you submit up to your your maycom and the maycom is the one who would actually submit up to OSD. So you really find someone unless they've worked at that level.Who are have those skill sets, but again, if they understand the, you know the PBE process and and the data elements and things of that nature, you can train them on the systems. And so you know the processes and so Coms processes and things of that nature. So.It can be a little bit challenging, more in code management than in the area that Irma is in, and it it takes a while. I'm I'm gonna be honest. Like you can't, you know, you don't expect someone. I don't expect someone to come in who doesn't have experience with that and just instantly, you know, catch on and understand because not only do you have the challenge of learning, you know, the codes and the crosswalks and things of that nature.Then you also have to learn so calms data architecture and our SOCOM speak we we speak a little different language than anyone else that old.Yeah. Ohh SD we have what they call the element of cost EOC's which is nowhere else across the department and so you're not only learning, you know, just the basic process. Then you also have to learn so calms architecture on top of that. So it could take a little while."
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Umm, so here within SOCOM. As I've mentioned, SOCOM we don't have.We have service like responsibilities. If you probably heard that. So what that means is we are not a service but our our commander uh, SOCOM commander, he has.What is the title 10 authority that he has to submit? He is responsible for submitting the palm budget and programming.Data up to far for Socom's MFP 11 funds, right? Which is our soft funds up to OSD and to Congress and the budget. And So what? Just if you can think and imagine that we have we are we have data that's coming in from the various service systems. So if you recall I said we had 11 different service systems that we're pulling data in from because so calm for our suborder commands, you have army, you have Air Force, you have Navy, you have the Marine Corps so.All of those we have to pull all the data from those service systems which are not not the same. They're very disparate data elements and systems. And now we have to pull that into SOCOM, into our system and put it in a, if you will, try to combine that into a language that's common in the same across the board here within the command. And So what we've created within the command, they have these element of cost and the element of cost.What what it does is for each one of our programs that you know dollars that's associated with it, you have a ELC.Be associated with a a specific program and then from there you know you said OK, this is tied to this particular fiscal year and across the across the fight up and so that's unique to SOCOM. What we are actually doing here in system integration. So we have two big initiatives going on right now. One is the advana budget execution and bringing all that data into the centralized platform, right. And then the second one is we're doing what we call.Data restructure and what we're doing for the data restructure because SOCOM has, like I said, this unique our own language, right? We're talking our own language. But if I'm coming in brand new into this command and I see this ELC, the ELC is is right now it's currently is limited to 15 characters and all that is like concatenated into 115 character where I'm trying to say that within this program it's our you know C.The 30 aircraft and it may be the system upgrades to that well, unless you have some kind of decoder ring or something to that nature you have no clue. Someone coming in as to what that is, what we're doing here and systems integration right now is we're looking at the data quality so.Uh, we are for our data elements. We we are improving the data quality. So what we wanna do is standardize everything because it's not standardized. If you look in the system which is the P business, where standardizing the those data elements and then what we're breaking them down is to what we call plain language. And so now you're not limited to this 15 characters at, you need to find the decoder ring to figure out what is in this funding line. We're actually breaking it out where you can plainly see.That it's the C 1:30. It's a system upgrade, and an FY22 is X amount of dollars that's been allocated against that. So that's a huge undertaking that we are in the process of of working right now simultaneously with the ADVANA initiative over."
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Absolutely. So you can break it apart and so that you can, you know, if you wanted to look to see, you know, how much is the the cost of a program now, we won't. I'm I'm not gonna say that we're gonna be there 100% but we'll be much closer than where we are today because what we're doing is we're adding tags to it and things of that nature so that you can select different criterias all depend on the data sets that you're trying to pull from the database that you'll be able to get a better picture.And and closer to accuracy of how much a particular system or program cost."
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I'm So what we actually do, we have what we call a CCB working group, which we are talking to the stakeholders. So we this effort has been going on for two years. Right now what we did was we initially talked to the different stakeholders within the headquarters.To find out, OK, what is your requirement and how we we we put it in different categories and buckets. We did what statutory or regulatory requirement, OSD requirement and then we looked at SOCOM specific requirement and from there we identify OK these are the data elements that's required. So the statutory regulatory OSD, we know those are required the SOCOM specific requirements. We looked at that to see if that was appropriate.And does it properly fit within the previous Miss database, right? And is that something that we we are required to report on to, for to Congress and because you know those you can't get everything in there. And so once we did that, we kind of we briefed that up to our leadership, our leadership approved it and from there we moved on to the next phase. And so throughout this process and phases we have the stakeholders are intimately involved in that.So we have identified and we what we've done now is pulled all those codes that I was referencing and we've broken those codes down into what we call the plain language right for each data element. And we formed that out to the stakeholders, told them what was required and they've been, they've given us feedback and now we're in the process of reading through all of that data so that we can standardize the data across the command within the people business database.So we we are, I'll say maybe we're about 25% getting there. It's gonna take us a while and that's what the meeting we were in actually before we jumped on to this meeting because we actually after we get the information from the stakeholders and then what we do is have internal working group meetings amongst of our team to now break this out once we get everything in the format that we believe that the stakeholder was requesting, then we'll go back to them and say is this what your intent was?But it will be in a standardized format, so that it'll be standardized across the enterprise."
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","So we yes, yes. So we are not doing this in a vacuum. We are definitely you know make sure that we reach back to the stakeholders and getting their requirements. So because the data is no good, if they don't understand it or they are unable to use it. So we we definitely want to make sure that we get this right the first time."
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Umm, I can't think of any right now. Like I said, I'm really excited. I think with with Advana and with this data restructure that we're doing and not only with the data restructure, but we're also implementing a different software. It's called one stream. Yeah. I think once we get those, I'll be ready for a pause, to be honest.But but no, I think once we get those in, we we just have to, you know evaluate once we get them up and running to see if there's any improvements or any changes you know that we need to make in the future. But right now those those initiatives I I think will answer a whole lot for soft. I'm not just so sofam but for the SOCOM enterprise because it'll give you know us and everyone across the enterprise visibility and advana.Of you know our execution. So we're we're excited for it."
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","So once I do so once this, you know, once you've completed your interviews with saw from like whoa, you give us some feedback, will there be like, you know, a report or assessment like, what's the process after you've completed your interviews to see, you know, is this to see how we're using data? And, you know, like you said, where we could improve or, you know, the processes like what what will there be an product or final product for us?"
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, I mean, I really appreciate you. I really appreciate your time and that you know you giving us the opportunity to kind of.You know, be a part of this. I know this is a a big initiative than push of the vice commanders. If there's just something that I could offer to you all, just just from some of the feedback because, you know, I was intimately involved in helping, you know, set up the interviews and everything. Victor, that those questions scared everybody. So."
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",You.
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I met you. You actually had some people who were really hesitant to volunteer for the interviews because once they looked at the questions, they just felt like, like, I don't know, the answers to all these. I can't answer these questions.But."
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","But no, we you know, I I think there's some may have reached out to you and we put their mind at ease as well like hey you know you don't have to have all the answers to the questions it's just some of the some of the questions that they may ask or you know this is kind of what they're looking for for their assessment so it kind of people putting people's mind at ease because initially I just to let you know I'd sent the e-mail and say hey you need to look at all of these questions and be prepared to answer it and yeah they were running for the hills but now this has been."
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","This has been great, so really really appreciate it."
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","But no, thank you. You just letting the call know that. Yeah, I meant Nick is a huge asset. Like the for the ADVANTA initiative. We definitely. Uh. He came on at the right time because we need his expertise.You know in that area cause that's that's something that we just we don't have any experience with. So we were getting ready to move into integration when he came on board and we had a a working group meeting with OSD and he was there throughout the, you know, the beginning of the process. So we really, really appreciate it. So please pass that on."
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Are you too?
"Sablan, Priscilla A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Bye bye.
"Anderson-Moore, Erma A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Thank you.
"Cole, Trivia L CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",OK. Bye bye.
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, ma'am."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",I am the division chief for Travel Oversight and compliance. I've been here about two years.
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","We're actually a new division, we we're just stood up two years ago.And we we help structure policy and.As well as provide internal review and assessments for the TTY conducted throughout the SOCOM enterprise."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Most of our deliberate deliverables we don't necessarily have. You know, we don't make widgets.What we do is we a lot of times we provide policy interpretation either from like the JTR, the FMR, you know, a slew of SOCOM regulations and or service department regulations. We also develop and establish new policy for SOCOM that, again aligns with all of those.You know, DoD and other federal guidelines.Some of our other deliverables would probably we.Assess the inspector general's office. We are the schemes for travel, so we also conduct.Umm, audits and reviews on their behalf as well as we are at times appointed by the command to conduct investigations.Umm, some of our other deliverables we do have, there are some reporting requirements outlined within various DoD regulations for travel as well As for the government travel Charge card program.And the report itself isn't the deliverable. The analysis against the report often is.Umm, you know how many people are delinquent, you know, or people or people?Being prudent when they go on TDY. Yeah, we run a myriad of reports to analyze.That and we also use those reports to develop other policies, should there be gaps."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Most of the reports it depends on the report itself.Well, we provide oversight for the HQ and portions of the enterprise.The internal office, the Jader and Center OTA's travel administrators. They run and execute many of these reports for their own travelers. We also execute them as the oversight office. We also are the.We are also the sneeze. As for travel and GTCC as an assessable unit for the ARMIK program so.We don't execute them in the same fashion that the officers do, but we do analyze and execute when necessary. But our analysis is again more directed towards.Are people using their their money judiciously? UM, are there gaps in the way that people travel that need to be addressed and potentially internal policies developed for that?We also measure have policies that we've written. Have they had an impact?But yeah, the way that we run the reports is often different. The way that they're the same reports are being executed in the traders."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","It depends on what the request is. If the request is specific here within headquarters, we can often just run reports out of the vendor systems either like Citibank and or DTS. However, if it's enterprise wide, we would typically have to go to DMDC to get that data dump.Because I mean pulling it from DTS is just entirely too laborious and too cumbersome, so I would typically go to DMDC and request that data dump directly from them."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",I'm mostly number one. It's it's an age system. It's it's actually considered twilight. Now they have a new system coming in behind it. Will we ever move to the new travel system? Not anytime in the near future.Umm.
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","But a lot of the reporting mechanisms it it was originally built to be a reservation system, but then they just kept adding things on after the fact and adding things on at the last minute like the budget module, the budget module does. It just can't do basic math and it's kind of sad. But yeah, the budget module will, I mean it's.It's a reasonable indicator, but it's also not your you know the budget module and DTS. That is not your official accounting system, so it's allowed to be off.You know, reports are very challenging and DTS because the the the formulation and the syntax of the report does not follow from one report to another, you could have one report that the name first, middle initial and last is in one cell where is another report is broken out in the three cells. Then you know all of a sudden you're having to concatenate stuff in order to you know to match things.Umm yeah, it's a nightmare.Just you know something as.The construction syntax across reports not being identical, it's, you know, it's it's kind of ridiculous that somebody even thought that might be a good idea. But, but yeah, that's that's mostly.What makes them cumbersome, and that's often why we have to go to DMDC just to get data dumps because it's, you know, it's very basic, it's from a database, it's Excel ready and you know, you don't have to do as much.Pre work manipulation on an order to get it to a state where you can start performing analysis against it."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Exactly. It's it's really frustrating and you know, sometimes we also have to marry DTS reports against Citibank reports. And I mean those are two entirely different systems. You know, you kind of get it that the construction of cells is a little bit different. You're gonna have to massage it a little bit before it's even going to work before you can even get your, you know, whatever macros you've built to get it to work. But now when you're talking DTS reports and all these canned reports that they don't.Have that consistency across them. It's it's mind blowing."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","But so com doesn't own this system, you know, uh, DTO owns this system so."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, they'll actually build queries for us.Umm, we're kind of unique in that one. We're a joint command and.DTS was constructed, constructed based around personnel affiliation, not mission affiliation. So when you're talking about maps back, they're actually assigned under the Navy and DTS. And so we have very limited access because the Navy.By DTS standards, the Navy owns them, even though they are soft people using soft money on and soft controls, so Coms controls their mission.There was knapsack. People are under the Navy, so within DTS itself I have very limited access to pull information. However, DMDC recognizes our, you know, our title 10 authority against these enterprise components and so they will give it to us. And typically I'll tell them what I want my end result to be. And sometimes we have to back into what it is I'm really looking for. But yeah, they typically do ad hoc queries.For us and they will build them for us, depending on what it is we need and whether or not they can even provide it. You know, there has been maybe 1 occasion where they're like, yeah, we can't do that. That's that's, you know.But."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","A little bit of both. The data is there, but there's gaps within the data that no query could be built in order to bridge those gaps.You know, with any system it's it's only as effective as its users input.And there's information that users put in DTS that.You know, it's not consistent from Traveler to traveler and so too many assumptions provides gaps within this information. And yeah, it's just it's often something they just can't build because they can't.You know they can't build intellect into their or assumptions into their queries."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Perfect example. We recently we have a policy sitting right now with the cheap stuff. I'm waiting for signature.The GTR allows for up to 300% in excess over GSA rates for lodging reimbursement on this called actual expenses. Well well Jr allows up to 300% for the AO to approve it on this sometimes. Let's just say that that that's used.Umm, that's used in a manner this questionable, even though you're allowed to do actual expenses, you still need to tie it to mission. They're still, they're still requirements. In order to validate and justify using area.And again.There wasn't a travel office that SOCOM. There was a, you know, there was a travel help desk, but there wasn't a travel offset. So calm two years ago.So when we came on board, we.We did a we pulled a lot of different data to see where some of these gaps, these immediate cost saving gaps.Umm lay so we could start building policy against them in the EA was one of the. I mean it was a no brainer. I've never been in an organization that didn't have an internal graduated area policy and so that's.You know the the way the fashion of the fashion of which it was being used previously was.Umm, it's not. It wasn't egregious, but there was no documentation or justification for its uses. So yeah, we kind of put some, you know, for the restrictions and for their documentation requirements before you just hit that button."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, they do. Yeah, they do exactly and.Yeah. I mean, if you're military and you're oconus, you can even, you know, potentially get even higher than that, but.Umm yeah, and sometimes it is absolutely warranted. But you still need to cover your bases if you have to utilize it."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Sometimes this cost saving, sometimes you know it's it's related specific to mission.Sometimes it's just.You know, we might, we might notice something here in the office. We're like, wait a second. Is this a trend? This is like, the third time this question has come up this week. Maybe we need to look and see if this is something we need to look at and another one that we recently had. And actually DMDC is working on a query for us right now is.Because we're joint and because we have.We have all the service branches represented.Should we need?Should we need exceptions to policy outside of the JTR, we would have to go to the secretarial process for each service member and each service branch represented within SOCOM.That's laborious and you know I'm sorry, but no."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Like, I'm not gonna do that now. It's it's it's a huge administrative burden.And so sometimes we will write requests for exceptions to policy to realign secretarial processes here, back to our four-star.And again, it might not. It's not necessarily gonna have any cost savings. It's gonna have administrative. It's gonna relieve some of the administrative burden."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Ohh no stuff like that. It has to go through. Ohhh my gosh so many people have to scratch and sniff those things.And you know, they all have to go through form 14 and all these people because that particular one.That particular one.It has to be signed. I think they're gonna, I think the intent is to post it to the vice commander to send it up to the PDT tag. But before device command or even sees it has to go through cheapest staff. It has to go through, you know, the director of support has to go through all these people. And part of that part of the write up is why are we even doing this?And I even had to brief them last week. You know, we'll we need to understand it's used. And can you pull all these metrics because you know we don't we wanna make sure that this really is in need and really is a requirement before we put it in front of the vice commander. But no all of that all of that information of you know is the squeeze worth it all of that has to be provided in advance it's not solely.That knowledge doesn't solely held within this office. It has to be communicated in order for our policies to be considered and or signed."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I'm sorry, what was that again?"
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","For that particular one, for the exception policies regarding the Secretary of process, yeah, there's not gonna be any follow up on that because we are, we are essentially asking.Umm, you know, for just a realignment of authority. It's not gonna really have any any financial bearing. So to say. Now the AEA policy. I would fully expect a request to come down for, you know, to to see if we've had any cost savings primarily because in our request to implement this policy, we showed the potential monies lost. So."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Obviously somebody's gonna somebody sooner or later, and we're, you know, with it also.We'd also run that data for our own edification."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Correct. And I mean it's gonna be added to our our Met checklist as well. So whether or not we're looking at it from a money standpoint, we're obviously looking to make sure that the policy is being being utilized correctly."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",I do. Yeah. So I typically build them.
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",I unfortunately yeah. Unfortunately my team members do not have extensive Excel skills.I I.
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, I build most of our macros for Excel and I'm not even that good at. It takes me forever, but I I can I can work through it. You know, I can hack one out if I have to."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Well, I eventually learned those skills. UM, no, most of mine. I'll you know, I just picked it up along the way. I've I've really not had any formal Excel training. I'll just Google it and watch the YouTube on it and then I'll I'll write it down the link where I found it and give a little description of what it was, you know.What it was I queried to even find the the tutorial on it."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","100% absolutely 100%.And you know, obviously you training money is often hard to come by. But fortunately with something like Excel, there is so many online tutorials and there's so many people out there just providing the information for free that as long as they don't shut down our YouTube again then."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","You know, they could. They could actually do a lot of self training. Obviously it is helpful if you do get some, you know at least a week long core class to build on. But.No, I absolutely.Support even people just learning from you know, some of the little YouTube videos and stuff you can find, or Mr Excel. That one is a really good website."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, the explanations on Mr Excel are the best bar none, even though there's not videos the way people. Yeah, the way people explain things, it just it clicks for me."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Oh, I might not give them the the option, but to attend.It might be a. You will be here at this time and date, you know, cause even even outside of my office, there was skills are so beneficial.Umm, you know, I mean this is, you know, the financial management center, so.You know it's reasonable to expect.You know.Pretty good Excel skills I think maybe maybe, I don't know. Maybe I'm not. Maybe I'm not playing fair, but I would think."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, but you know, I'll be honest with you though, I, I, you know, I've worked in FM most of my life and it's to me, it's really shocking how little Excel knowledge a lot of people in FM do have.It's kind of shocking."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Ah.Yeah, I know. I just, I think everybody should, you know, have some Excel skills beyond, you know, equal sum."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",No.
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I absolutely could Umm could I provide them, you know, like a full billet worth? Maybe not. Could I have a shared billet worth? Absolutely."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Exponentially gas. I think the return on investment for somebody like that would just be, you know mind blowing.I could keep them gainfully occupied for quite some time, but then it would probably weigh off. You know, once I gonna reaching an order.You know.Exact."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Play exactly.
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No.No, not my office."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I I I really don't know much about it, Anna. I know.I know DMDC uses it to extract some of the information from DTS. Some of it they just pull from, you know, DTS code. I would be absolutely interested in learning about it 100%."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Our policies cannot reach the perimeters that have already been set forth by the FMR JTR, DSR. We can work within those scopes, but we can't work outside of those scopes. There are also some benefits and entitlements that they are just that they're entitlements. You can't. Yeah, you can't really mess with somebody's entitlements too much.Uh.But.You know, that still leaves a decent amount of area to maneuver in and out of.But yeah, by and large are are parameters are set by various financial guidelines and regulations and and code you know you use code, but yeah."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",How do you mean?
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, I mean some of the reports that we get from DFAS, we we absolutely asked them to change some of the information provided."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah.From deep house, you know we get like improper payment reports, things like that and.Yeah, we we asked them to to add or you know, let them know well this this field isn't necessary to us if it's not necessary to you feel free to use it or feel free to lose it. And but no that we have on a couple of occasions asked for additional data."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Not honestly, not at the moment. All of my data does. None of my data comes from SOCOM. All of my data comes from exterior sources."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",So I can't. Yeah.
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",I'm sorry.
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","But yeah, yeah, right now all of my data comes from exterior sources."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Not that I can think of at the moment.
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, I don't think I do."
"Crawley, Sheila CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Thank you you as well.
"Dailey, Marcia L LTC USARMY USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",No.
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",No.
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Aye, Marcia, you want me to go first?"
"Dailey, Marcia L LTC USARMY USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Sure, actually think you can cover both of us because you have a longer tenure than my two years."
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I'll, I'll let you handle filling your gap so.Yeah. So I.Was a Air Force Palace acquire intern did my internship and Albuquerque.It curling Air Force Base after I got out of the Navy as a Navy SEAL.Did about eight years active duty. I'm about 3.Your years in the reserves with the SEAL teams.And then I came here in 2000, while I was still doing reserve duty.So I guess what 21 of May, 2223 years I've been in Sofam, originally it wasn't called sofam. It was called something else and it was part of J-8.And throughout that period, I.Started as a budget analyst and then a year or two was.We.Analyst and then supervisor.Going from GS11TO.She has 14 and about.Four years.Something like that I can't remember.And so.What's for many?Evolutions of reorganizations.Developing, formulating the budget request you know transitioning from the palm to the budget.Asked Miss submission OSD and then taking the decisions from the department, incorporating it into a.President's budget on him.Request and explaining.The increases and decreases and answer and congressional RFI's briefing during the rollout briefs picking gressil staffers.And at the same time doing execution.Umm.Then went through a period where I was just doing the budget formulation.And then I was.There that several years as sort of a.The what do you call it? Deputy for the.Division chief the GS15, or 06 for several years with science projects.A lot of them.Dealt with data and.Developing ways to tease out data, identify data or trends.And different areas that weren't common weren't normal. It wasn't the way we normally program, budget, execute funds, but Congress or other entities were interested in it because it became a divisive issue.You know, lots of those science projects. And then I came back.And became.The.Chief for the OEM execution. I've been doing that.It's about 2014.And so that basically is.You know, maintaining the books behind the scenes of the funds that get enacted or the Congress continuing resolution funds if in lieu of an appropriation.Managing the distribution of that out to the components.Identifying.Emerging requirements and developing methods to prioritize those to.Ensure of mission critical stuff gets funded in the year of execution.And all reports to OSD, Congress, whatever are made on time and recorded.Obligations are recorded accurately.So yeah, that's.Sort of a.Synopsis of what I do in my tenure here."
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, I exhausted all my youthful rocket fuel by about 2010. I'm just on fumes now."
"Dailey, Marcia L LTC USARMY USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Right.So I've been here just slightly over 2 years. I have worked in the budget execution section, so prior to come into SOCOM have been an army officer and I've only worked in their system.Gfebs.So it's quite different here, where I actually not in the execution system more so of the.The system we use consolidate all these information from the various services. I think we call them PB, Miss Hyperion.And so forth. So primarily I work current year execution.We also worked the integrated.And funded prior to lists we call that I you pull basically that's the.The process we go to get the you first approved annually. I guess there's a modules in Hyperion that we also use to execute that. There's a sock you from module that we use to consolidate.The component submissions. We also use the sock spin module where the component submit their spin plan.And I think there's another one that can't really recall right now that actually help us with actuals at the end of the fiscal year.So yeah, most of my stuff is execution, current year and getting that budget executed and closed out when the year ends."
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, I think to add one more CSS that it up until about.Three years ago.When was that? What are we in now, 22 about?For about 2014 to 19 or 20.I had like.11 people on a contractor included military from.All services and civilians and a contractor.I got just kind of too big to handle and too much to learn all the different appraisal systems and we forms and we wanted to use the military.Uh 040 fives give them.Ah.More responsibility and autonomy. So.Made the recommendation to split budget execution into two, but they both handled execution here issues.So we made.No budget execution into.BENBC soften BBC budget execution and budget. Current OPS and current OPS is what, Marcia?Is the chief of and that's the the military with two civilians that are.Matrix to her.That function, as the desk officers for all our components, T socks and AT&L for execution issues.And often more than just execution issues. Anything resource or financial authority related.That store their entry point into soften SOCOM for their questions, issues, problems they're having.As well as their.Issuing their current year execution funding.And or their shortfalls.So we split into about three years ago. So Marcia has got the other side."
"Dailey, Marcia L LTC USARMY USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yes. So normally we'll start with at that account mainly through e-mail that goes out to the components.And they'll have a suspense where we.Would like the information returned by. They use the input their requirements into the sock you for module that's in Hyperion.I don't think that we're using.Hyperion to the Max extent.Because.We use it here in subform. I think the jade have the capacity to use it, but for whatever reason I'm not sure why they don't.But UM.From our end, once the components put their information in, I basically run a compiled spreadsheet and then we work from that.I think there's the ability to go back in and rank order EU first.But some.What I'm trying to say, I'm trying to say that the.The process is broken basically at the point I sent it to the J8 because they don't get utilize the system."
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I can.I can fill in and blind you with some history if you want on this particular, probably every one of them. So I gotta be careful about.Keeping it short but.Umm."
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Umm.So.Yeah, I'm you for processes to.Uh collect and review. Prioritize.Umm has evolved and gone through.Numerous numerous forms or fashions over the years, and it's something I, one of the first things that I started on, you know, 22 years ago.And in the early years, you know, I took it over for like 7 years, starting about 2000.3 or 4 to 2010.And like I said, you know, I got here when I was.But like 38, I'm 60, so I burn a lot of rocket fuel coming here.You know, fresh out of finance degree and statistical modeling and database.Mowing and.All kinds of other stuff. So I had all these ideas and I was.You know what I did? An intern with the Air Force. Everything was in one system.It was much more concentrated, easier to find.I got here and it was absolute chaos because socom's an appeal on funding funding.Is distributed an executive violence components who are all in different accounting systems?And so there's so many crosswalks that have to be manually maintained or created and maintained to track and identify it.For.Umm, processed the budget process, the execution accounting everything.Not to mention.You know, there's a relationship you expect to be able to get payroll data from the services, but.All our civilian pay gets executed and all the different service accounting systems.So it's just been a nightmare and it started out with all these.Right ambitions and.For I really are about 10 years and I.To this it's like one step forward, 2 steps back, but for the euphoric process.You know, we issue guidance to the components about how many users, what types you know what, what not to submit, what isn't considered a you for what they.Need to fund themselves and not come into this headquarters for.We started out early on having them submit them as either.You know.What do we call it? Mission.Uh Ascential mission enhancing and and or critical.And we used to have a SOCOM 1-8 that.Went along with the the What do they call the PBS miss? Which is where all the data for?Programming and budgeting was retained. Anything from aircraft inventory to civilian FTE cost factors.Amounts all that type of stuff and.The Jay maintains something called the RCC PVL list. The resource constraint capabilities list or something like that.And they would prioritize all the SOCOM programs, and we try to piggy off the back off of that to help guide prioritization of a you first, but.But but the 1-8 governed all the data and I have copies of it and it hasn't been updated and God knows I don't know.13 years I I can't remember. I think once we moved on to Hyperion and once Admiral Mcraven got here and revamped.The whole SP process, strategic planning and programming.That old 1-8 governed.A resourcing PS Miss database. The codes the fields, all that stuff.You know, some of the things.Yeah, we'll just weren't maintained anymore. But that actually had definitions of what mission, essential enhancing and critical were, which we used in the ether process to help.Guide the prioritization of the year first and we would have a working group once they've resource submitted.We would convene our working group and we would have Members from the J code staff.As part of the you for working groups saw or saw them.Myself would facilitate, so I would say chair, but not really a chair. We would facilitate it discussion.We review all of them, debate the pros, cons, see if it really was a P11 requirement. It should be a service requirement, you know, you know, is this requirement? They submitted something that was supported in the palm or not.So.We went through that and a lot of times we got the components on for PTC's to.We'll provide, you know, follow on input.Thank you for working group would come up with a recommended prioritization and we would brief it back then we had a.On the one we're part of J, we had the.What was it called the?To your joint resources working group, joint Resources Management Board and then the joint Resources Execution Council and then a BOD for directors.And.We would brief.Our recommended priorization first, the components get their feedback.Take it to the general B.Which was at the.Uh controllers last J-8 level.Then we would brief it for approval or guidance.To the chain J wreck the Executive Council, which was chaired by the at that time deputy commander.And then once we got a prioritized list that has to get funding was available, we try to go move down funding those you first priority order.We've tried all kinds of.Different evolutions to.Create models that would help automate the prioritization. We had something called a storm model.We would wait.Weight certain elements that were.Uh.You know higher priority from the J8.And other things. And we come out with a weighted one we looked at and did demos of some hybrid commercial off the shelf products that other components are using to help them prioritize.These type of requirements.And so it went back and forth through a lot of iterations, the working group.Kind of devolved into.Action officer participation and we tried to get make sure that those action officers.Briefed.They are leadership so that they knew it was going on so that when I got briefed to.Sarah.Uh, Karen B or Jarek? Nobody was surprised.But it never seemed to work, no matter how much they said. Oh yeah, we got them in there like we show up and brief it and went up at JAD's or somebody would come back on it. No, it's like, first I heard of this. What's going on?Ohh so.Umm.So we stumbled along doing that for years, and then about three years ago, like right before the pandemic, or right when it was starting.Some of this is personality driven. Who who is in charge of J8, who's in charge of, who's the vice commander or whatever.So.They wanted to get them involved.Like dual chair.Process where.We collect. We sent out the guidance we collect, we review from a pure financial standpoint like is it executable? Is it the right color of money? You know, all that kind of stuff and then?Then we sent it over to J-8 and J-8. Does the actual prioritization based on the NDS National Defense strategy and the other?Uh. Priorities.Have been deemed by the Sea G for their.The SP's pretty strategic planning process. So they would take over the prioritization process and then we'd reconvene and we'd brief it through.You know ESB, PSG or?Uh.That level to get.To obtain.Incurrence from the components the Jaco staff.And then ultimately the vice commander.And so that's kind of how it's evolved in the last three years. So we're more just a facilitator. We're not as much in the.Business of what we did for years and years, trying to do a working group and apply.Some type of a model that would help automate a portion of it.And then do the rest.Umm.Based on a military experience or other things.I don't know if any of that made sense but.What's going on?"
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I'm personal opinion has this like the budget.And other things is it's.Thankless job. You will never please ever any everyone or not, even though adjarian problem, somebody always has a gripe or complaint or something falls through the cracks and it's very frustrating and everybody tries to acknowledge there should be some way to help prioritize or help at least.Some way with AI or whatever big data to.Create something that help automating portion of this.And.So like every time we try to engage to guide.What about this as a criteria? What if we set this up as a pre screen to help put it in some initial order that we can then work with? Or you guys can work with and J 8?Umm.That maybe.Helps us along in the prioritization, or at least give us some.You know better.Better leg to stand on when going from the components with the vice commander about why we made these decisions on this current prioritization."
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yes, and I think.Yes.I think someone think it's too much or the the criteria.Uh might change too frequently too often, especially if the unity CG you're getting new guidance from D you get new. Another a new updated National Defense strategy or chairman's.Chairman's guidance for the department.Or something real world happens and all. My gosh. OK. Drop everything you were doing and do this. I I you know.And the other thing that falls through is stuff that is.Just kind of a fact of life. You just gotta pay it, I mean.And there's like a cost increase and it.You don't know about that because it's even like commercial.Spear or somewhere else where?You just find out about it and there's no time to put it funding in the palm to cover the increase.So it's not your budget and it's not your appropriation. You know, things like that.And that's difficult to deal with because everybody wants to focus on mission criticality and you know, OK.This isn't very sexy, but you know it's a cost increase for this or that contract or whatever, and you're in the contract. You don't wanna tell everybody, go home and stop it.You gotta pay it.Those things.Uh, kind of mock up the user system as well. There's not a real.Good way to.Deal with those comparing side by side with real world operational things."
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yeah.
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Well, like you know, I.They're, they're busy. They're SOCOM has lots of meetings, lots of."
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Staff synchronization so when you get above you know to the 06 GS 15 or above level, you know you're competing for time.Umm.And.The you for working group that I referred to is. You know that's that's something that's say that J-8 or J6. We want them to show up and we want somebody to at least the GS 14 or 15 level.You know that it's this is sort of an add-on duty. It's not a part of their core. You know their position description.And so they have folks that work for them that they would send over. And I'm not saying those people didn't help or do everything, but.You know.I'm not sure the communication back to the right people was complete or thorough.So when you get to an executive leadership where you and those people do show up, sometimes they felt like they were caught off guard or.Yeah.Decisions were made that they wouldn't have.Gone along with.Yeah."
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","So and there was also the competing interest, if you have folks from a J code, we're looking for their expertise to look like for the J6 to the like, look at the you know U-verse that gets submitted for comms, radios IT, whatever to make sure that it fits in with the whole SOCOM enterprise.And is this somebody just doing something new that isn't?You know something that that Jay six is trying to plan for the future or whatever. You know, that's just an example, but.When we had the folks show up to the working room from J6 or J-8 or.Wherever it was.Umm.We ran into a lot of.Conflicts of interest because we allow the headquarters.You know chief of staff.Is a component that we issue money to, so they are part of the Euphrates role and they submit you first.So a lot of times.Whoever showed up the working room from some of those directorates as the.Member of the User Working group.Sometimes if a big dog like an 06 or somebody really did show up, it was there to.Heavy handedly.Umm.Tout there you for that they had a euphoric that was on the list and they wanted to make the case work instead of being the.Ah.Expert non biased person to help.You know we have.Or review and prioritize all the you first does that make sense?"
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I mean, I think I, I I would hope they would.I would say that you know some of the components have actually approached the same why don't you use this? We use this.And it helps it also do.You know.50% of the NUG work and then we take it from there manually or something like that or it's just you know.As long as we're talking about databases and that type of stuff, I would say that the mechanics behind this.Started off ages ago as emails, Excel spreadsheets you know combining them all that type of stuff we quickly moved.Probably in like.2005 Ish or something we started using.The portal.Uh.You know where you set up a.A portal site and they build a template into the portal site where they fill them in there and then you can sort it or you can export the spreadsheet. You know that type of stuff.It was kind of clunky it.And and it wasn't.It didn't.Kind of foster collaborative working or flow working.And comments and answering questions.Umm.It was more of an archive and it was hard because a lot of the stuff is you're asking for explanations, justification, which is.You know, verbage.Which when you when we set it up like that.You know, it ended up treating it sort of like a spreadsheet. So you're cream and a whole page worth both.Verde agenda.Cell or something like that.But then we moved on to some other ways to do it, and then we built it into the current Hyperion 1. Some of those work better.Umm, you know, we had places where.You could pass it off.And it had a feel for softened comments or soften recommendation. Recommend recommended.Ohh priority and then it will pass it off to J8. They would come in and comment or put in an RFI.I asked him somebody to get with Assoc to answer this question.Then they put the answer in there and then.Ohh.Then they would put their recommended priority in there, and then the system would kind of.You know merge the two.Some of that worked better. It was a little more collaborative and the flow work better, but nothing's been perfect.Umm, so like Marcia was saying, they put it in Hyperion.But whatever really wants is a lot of verbiage to explain why they really think they need this. Why aren't? Why didn't they do this? Why didn't they ask where the poem you know? Answer all these questions?Umm.And most of those questions are, are text verbal? They're not.Numbers.Umm.So it's.It's not always a.Yeah, it's not always user friendly."
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, I definitely, I say yes, it's gotten better, but it's definitely not.Ain't there yet so."
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Well.I would say that if you entered it in there and you ran it, if there were, you know, I've seen some tools or things the private sector uses. I mean, there's ways if you want to create a.Some type of a modeling that prioritize it based on a criteria. You just gotta make sure you've got the right criteria and you maintain it correctly.And then once it.Does that.I guess the best I would say is some of these systems I see that have a flow to it where you it's gotta be a.Reviewed and checked or.Kind of like the form 14 or.The Mt or something like that.You know where there's a."
"Dailey, Marcia L LTC USARMY USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yeah.
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, yeah. And then.So.Yeah, I mean, I've I've asked over the years for J-8.80s like, hey, man, you finished the palm. Hey, can you give us, like, the top ten programs for areas where?When you finish the palm, if you had additional O&M, where would you put that O&M?And maybe we can wait those things higher in the you for process, but I've.The.I haven't asked that question about three years, but I asked it periodically like every two or three years, for like 12 years. And I always got. I can't really do that. It's not kind of the way we do things, but whatever, but."
"Dailey, Marcia L LTC USARMY USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. So for that suck you for module, I would like to see where it goes from beginning to end instead of breaking in the middle and then we're sending emails back and forth. So once they once the components.Send their information. We can come back, we can consolidate it into the spreadsheet, but leave the spreadsheet into the system where the J8 can go and access it.As one document instead of individual documents or being emailed a spreadsheet, they can make their decisions and then it can flow back to us, and then we can see the end state that would be ideal."
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","They if we've got them and if we got all these fields that everybody wants us to collect for, to, for them, to answer question just no. Or is this a contractor or was this phone in the palm? What's so critical about it? Justify it. You know, all that type of stuff.If it could.You know, take that and.Sort of at the end.Umm, it would add some of the feed. You have a feature to go add to it as you got RFI.Answers back from the components.And then it maybe it has a way to take that data and.Split it up and create a.One quad chart.Type thing and a PowerPoint.No, but the biggest thing I think it needs.It is historical archiving.And make a submission. Here's the initial one.Here was.The agreed upon jade soften prioritization once it went through all the approvals at leadership. Here's what the vice commander approved.Then it gets updated to say OK.We released funding and funded that you for we funded half of that you for on such and such date.And then you get to the end of fiscal year and it's complete and then it stays in there archives. So you can go back and find out, go check previous years. Did we fund that last year or two years ago or why are they keep submitting that you for over and over and how much?Umm, we're totally missing that aspect, that piece to be go back to, to kind of look at historical you for funding and trends and.That type of stuff."
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","And it may be, but I I don't have any, there's not a.Easy to use functional capability to pull in, state out.And use it.Like, yeah."
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, in state being OK.You know the.It got approved as a valid you for by the Vice commander once it made it through the whole rigmarole.And out. So that was in May.And then, you know, we had to wait, see what funding actually came available and say, June don't even became available and we funded.Eight million of their 10 million requirement.And then at the end of the fiscal year ends and so.You have a in state of.These these are the users off the list you got funded and the amounts.And you can go back anytime and pull up a simplified.List on here are the users for which components.You know what the program was that was funded in that you."
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Right.
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Not that I know of.I think the system we're currently doing it and I think my.I don't know. Last I heard. I not sure it's gonna be around much longer.Ohh.
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yeah.
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I don't know. I don't. You know, von is another.And another whole ball of wax so.That on our execution data.The whole there's another whole 22 years of history on that and I don't wanna burden you guys with that, but man, that's we started off with the euphoria. One I I would say the others are.Really messed up you for one is.At least it's sort of. We can wing it and make it work. The others are just totally.Master."
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, non attribution so."
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Well, when it first came up and started, you know, OK, well, how do we, where is it, Vanna? They keep bringing it up as examples. Hey, we got this out. OST would say or televised going. Hey, here's what we got out of Havana. Look what we can do and I'm like, OK, well, can we go in and look and see what they're looking at and.Not yet, no. Not yet. So Conn's data ain't there. There's they're still working because there's all kinds of.Disconnects behind the scenes, and so we were leery that we were looking at at imperfect data.But my folks.Not not the soften accountants or some of the code management folks, but.For the past year or so, trying to just go and get access to get in there.We kept being told no. Not yet. Don't do it or don't.You know, get access or whatever.And so.My folks can handle all that type of stuff.Execution data that would be there that we have to present internally.Umm.I think just recently one of them got access but it was limited access.Two of them have access to what they call these advana tools.It's not really access into the actual advana system. It's a intermediary tool that.Either feeds or just.Pulls a certain data set out of it.For you to review, update or whatever, and one of them is like the spin plan module.And so that they pull out the.You know they load advana like with what your PB request is and then they.Umm.By budget, activity or sub activity group and then.Alright.Tell you to go create your monthly spin plant off of that.And then that's going to go. Once you do that offline and this funky spreadsheet, then it goes back through the Vanna tool and it's gonna load it into advana. So Advana can go.Also come obligations monthly or whatever and match it against what your spin plan goes for. So it's these and there's another one for the contingency reporting for like Ukraine supplemental.That we have this manual liaison, one of the accountants with the advanta.Contractor up there.Umm.To let them know that it's.There are some issues with certain components that have transitioned to a new accounting systems where our data is not shown up in the defense 1:50, so you're not going to see it, but here's what it is and.And so there's this advantic contingency.Uh. Contingency operations execution tool and I haven't seen it. Now one of my folks does have access to that one as well as the spin plan one. And I think one of them has access into advana and they kept promising last year at this time that it was imminent, like at the end of November last year, give us the names of the folks and then we'll provide training, blah blah blah hasn't happened.So it's hard. I don't know. I've never been in about it. I don't. I don't have access to.But I know our accountants and code management folks are the ones that are working crazy with them, but they're trying to build out the architecture.Uh.4 advana to actually capture and collect our data accurately.Uh, because it wasn't doing that.You know.Over the last year or two, whenever they were demoing it."
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. I mean, I've heard the way it's advertised is gonna be utopia.You know.It's a lot of work on the scenes to get there, right?Knowing all the disconnects that have happened.With SOCOM financial data in the past that.It's gotta be a big mountain to climb."
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, I mean it when I.You ask and you whatever, and it's like, no, hold on for now. Don't do anything. Whatever. Still working on it. And then you come. OK, well, forget about it.And I know those folks are working on it. So I don't know, maybe maybe we can access it. It hasn't.There hasn't been like a.Recently, a big campaign to go get everybody access and training.Assume what you need a lot of training to make sure we know what we're doing in there because I thought I'd wanna handled more than just.Uh financial and accounting data. I thought I was trying to tie together with logistics and.Supply and all kinds of other things as well."
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, so I mean.The quick thing on accounting execution data.From a controller perspective.And all the DFAST data that goes through there and I talked about.Are in FP11 money gets distributed out to T socks components AT&L and then it gets executed and or sent to.Other service PO or program management offices for execution their systems.So it gets executed on all these different systems. Army, Navy, Air Force marines. You know Dai, whatever.And every single one of them have different accounting code structures, different fields, different names, different everything.And so, so calm has their own coding structure internally for Hyperion, for the PBS miss, which is where the repository for SOCOM.Uh to input?Their data at what level is that data goes down to?Umm to capture the review and capture the palm programming decisions? Capability decisions.Budget submission.And then the execution.And once you get below a certain level data code level and I have diagrams I've created over years to show that, you know throwing M.That that the data has to match or is maintained in all services and OSD down to this level. But when you get below that level and so Coms Hyperion database, all these codes are just so calm. Hybrid specifics they don't exist in any of those other accounting systems. So if you expect me to get data at that level.It ain't going to happen or.Or the one level they do want which is called the program.And or the element cost EOC.They want us to get.Accounting double data execution data that level. Then we have to build crosswalks.And so every year we have to send out.Umm.That sent out a data call with element of cost that we use in our Hyperion database. That's a SOCOM code.Umm, that everybody's familiar with in the palm and budget and you know.It's kind of like.Uh.Uh, my fifth special forces group, XNXX dot OPS. How much money? How much? Just option training. Money does the fifth special forces get, you know? And so that's like an example you see. So that doesn't exist in the Army accounting system.Ohm.So if you want to pull live execution data out of the system and actually be able to show that in real time, you know how much of they spent at that level in our SOCOM code.Then we have to create.Crosswalks and published them in the Defense 7097 every year and keep them up to date.The same thing if you want to code some of that, that that's special forces OPS money.As.Money they spent in support of.But continue overseas contingency like.Operation Enduring Sentinel.Over the horizon operations post Afghanistan.Then they have to go. We have to create a.Uh. Contingency code.And each service has a different way different alphanumeric digit way to implement their types of contingency code. So you have an ESP code to track that type of stuff, special events in the Air Force, and you got different combo in the.Uh, Navy or different one in the army?So you have to go publish.Those continuously cost code, keep those maintained in the Deep South rags and make and then you gotta just.Hope.That the E5 or whoever is going to do the document to execute the money somewhere that the fund site has that right code on it in order for it to come back to us on manually make its way through all these cross work blocks in the.DFAST data warehouse.Umm so that it will show up when we pull report.That those obligations were for the 5th Council Forces group.And.This, you know, out of that 25 million, three million was for operation during Sentinel.This much was Ukraine supplement all you know this much was for 127 echo connop operation and Country XYZ.We're running out of fields, track all things. They want us to track.Given the fact that.Our money gets executed and all the different accounting systems which all have different code coding structures.So.Yeah, everywhere."
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Always the Comptroller. They have a cost. About 10. Congress still has a requirement for the cost of war report, which is all those contingency.Dollars, even though OHKO went away.We get RFI's. We've got an RFI. So how much did we spend in?In Africa and this country hunting that whatever that guy was forgot his name, that we were hunting for like 5 years. Coney.Yeah.How much money did you spend in these ten countries in Africa? How much?You'd be surprised that they come as congressional RFI's they can come, OSD Comptroller. They can come from OSD Cape especially ask a lot of those.Umm.And.Quite frankly, some are so common, leadership just thinks or expects that all that's at the tip of our fingers.Umm.Yeah, it's very frustrating, so.But I I should back him. Just one piece quick. I'll make it quick. The.When I got here, major effort was going on. You know, they acknowledged SOCOM hat this issue that all their funding got executed and all these different accounting systems and the different services.And it was hard, hard to consolidate it and put it into some standardized.Form and code that we recognize here, and SOCOM and everybody's familiar with.Namely, our element of cost.And programs.So that's when they set up this accounting crosswalk canning code crosswalk.And we were part of the initial defense experiment because other agencies there were some other agencies that had the same type of issue. So they used us as a kind of a a trial.And it was called the Fist Financial Information system. And so they were going to pull all the soap on peel 11X, you know.Accounting obligation data.From Defassa daily so you could do it daily. It went into a data warehouse repository.Where it went into this gonkulator that.You know, if it was an army or Navy obligation.Document fun site. It would bump it up against the published accounting code or contingency code.It's like a Rosetta Stone, and it would say, OK, all the criteria meat. So that obligation from the army needs to feed this data code.Element for so calm.That's where it goes. And then we would go into the this which DFAS created.Umm.Uh.Where you would go run reports. You could customize your reports. You know if you wanted to just run it for use of sock or or this program. Whatever you pull the data and you could do it daily, monthly, whatever and it would populate.At the lower level, code that is so conspecific codes that everybody's familiar with in the program budgeting world here so come.You know, but.Initially there are a lot of disconnects. I'd say there were probably 15 to 10 to 15 percent, 20% rejections or disconnects.That you have to go work through.Up until about three years ago.The number of disconnects were really got whittled down to a minimal they were very manageable and we were able to create dashboards and all this great stuff and then all of a sudden.You know, Army went to G sibs. Then they're sensitive. Part went to Jeff's essay then.Marsha, I went to Dai. All these wheels started falling off. Data just got lost in there.In a black hole, it wasn't coming through the warehouse.And all those dashboards and stuff we created just kind of fell apart and we've been struggling, you know, relying on manual data calls to.The affected components that transition to different accounting systems.Did you fill in all the missing pieces to cobble together?Accurate execution reports for leadership and for OSD.So.Yeah. So.That started 22 years ago the 5th, the warehouse.And then I kind of fell apart two or three years ago when I heard that this is on life support. I heard last year that somehow it was discovered there were some kind of security.Underlying security vulnerability and they really wanted to shut down, shut it down as fast as possible.I think now they're trying to keep it on life support until they think advana is up and running.At a level that it would support our needs."
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. And so.And I, as anybody, brought up the whole.Sorbus affair."
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","So that was an AT and or SOCOM programmer record created. I don't know. I'm losing track of time probably.2008 nine 1011 something like that.And they actually, Jade actually palm put money against it, I don't know.I think there may have been already TNA Prague. I can't remember. IBM won the contract it was supposed to solve all this.Give us a better database for prompt program budgeting and include execution. Distribution of funds. Cause right now our distribution of funds is all based on a.Embellish spreadsheet created by.Uh.An analyst who now is a division chief in Sofam back in like 1998. It has so many tabs on it and so many.Access databases built off of it and other stuff.Then it's insane to maintain, but it's sort of like the offshore books. It's all the.It's sort of like.You know the ledgers behind the scenes of where we once we get the money from OSD, an annual appropriation. It goes on all these different buckets. And here's how much we're gonna give to asaki suckermouth. How much we're gonna hold back to centrally manage J sets or.And all that kind of stuff.And so that's all just we've tried one time we thought we had a solution from.Uh, I forgot the name of that company.Tacky.Yeah, anyway.But the controller at the time had a history with that company didn't like them and.The demo I saw, I thought it would solve all our problems with distribution. It was sort of like.Custom built, you know, commercial software, commercial accounting software that help do what we did and it would also help the euphoria.The way we've ran the euphor process, we were just talking about.But he hated that company based on his previous experience, and so it didn't matter whether this product was good or not. We didn't go down that Rd.No, but getting back to the sorta so formal record, I can't remember I.I thought at one point it was like.At one point funded for a between 9:00 and $12 million.I can't remember after two or three years, we had to meet with them to build this system.Me and my analyst, everybody over and over and over and describe it was like having a desk audit on your position. We had to go through everything we did and how we did it and document it. Going to rooms with big boards and diagrams everywhere.And we did that for like 2 years, took off ton of manpower, they collect all the stuff and.To get there. What? They're deliverables gonna be.And then it all just fell apart. I don't know.I'm not even sure. I don't even think I got any insight into what if they actually provided a deliverable and it didn't work. I don't, I don't know.Umm.But after about two 2 1/2 years of all that manpower of meat with them over and over.Yeah, just.One away and IBM probably got paid 7 or $8 million and there's there was nothing to show for it.The only thing we."
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Nope, man, the only thing.The only thing we actually got out of it, and I don't even know if we got it out of that, I the only thing came out of it was we got.The uh discover Oracle discover tool.So it's sort of like the Oracle BI tool now.But in my mind, the previous discover tool that was like an add-on, I think that was just a freebie that came with it. I don't think it was really part of what we.We're purchasing in through the SORBUS program.But in my mind.Might be I told that they got us using for query to piggyback on to Hyperion and pull data out.My view is it's a step backwards from the previous discover tool, so everything seems to be a step forward and two or three-step back. I've burned my rocket fuel.This was the top of my agenda for the 1st 10 years. It's just.Absolutely demoralizing."
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","All right, now that we're all happy."
"Nash, William F CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, I'm sorry I took it up. I I knew that was gonna happen. I mean, I really do have a lot of pin up.Rage and frustration about.From a resourcing financial aspect.The state of affairs with data, databases, systems, etc. Socom. I mean it infuriates me for the amount of money that I've seen go down. I know it's not sexy and operational, but if everybody wants and expects all this **** to just show up at her tip, you know they gotta put some money in it. I gotta do something.Even if it's like, OK, let's look at some commercial solutions. God knows. What are the big companies do? I'm. I'm fed up. It's just this is unsat.

"Foley, Lorrie A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Have any question about that? How my me asking is this a?They cannot understand part of the song initiative for SOCOM because I hadn't heard about it before.
"Foley, Lorrie A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, that's fine. I'm having a poor quality network on my end for, of course, right when this is happening, right?"
"Foley, Lorrie A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Umm.So I was just curious. I hadn't heard of UM.That really anybody is so calm talking about data until fairly recently when.A data storage came on board.The Sun New English with the so-called new Department. Or that's been around and I just hadn't heard about it.
"Foley, Lorrie A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","OK, great."
"Foley, Lorrie A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I started in sofa.2013 so just under 10 years ago, I actually started as a contractor.It was a contractor.Now.March of 2020, right before we went into COVID lockdown literally a week before.And so and I've been in the same department the whole time, even though we've divided.If I didn't department, so I'm actually heading a brand new division as well, so it's still trying to set that foundation for the division."
"Foley, Lorrie A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Sure. We do. The auditor, maybe you've heard today is an audit. And so our our kind of systems up division.Handles the actual audit with the independent auditors outside. You know the auditors outside of DoD.And so now things to audit as finding something to us and we go back to your organization and say, OK, we need to do corrective action plans for these and all of these issues that were found.And it's not because of the audit. The audit just found those issues that were they were fixing issues that we need this we need to do.For so calm to do business the right way.Uh, and and with in line with regulations and all of that good stuff so.It's really my division, this that I.Findings and corrective actions space on with.Almost every been some kind of the components to success.Do you fast? So I see.So from all of the services. So we're just we have hands in everywhere."
"Foley, Lorrie A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","It is, but so come when I came was so siloed that while people interacted, they only knew their little piece. They didn't know what happened beforehand, or what happened after hand afterwards. When they handed it off, it was just their little piece so siloed. We're still there. It's still coming around to be lot less I load."
"Foley, Lorrie A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","It's coming that direction. I think we were siloed for a lot of reasons, but.We're realizing more and more that we're headquarters and we need to start doing headquarters.It's.Because actors.Rather than.That's fine."
"Foley, Lorrie A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, let me do that."
"Foley, Lorrie A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, I said. That's not an issue at all. I got it. Thanks. You already got it there. Fine.I'll call in just a moment."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,Here we go. This should be much better.
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,Sorry about that.
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,That's very true.
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"Yes, yes. So you know we, we focused a lot on operations, which is great. I mean that's what we need to do as well.But then from that soap calm perspective, how do we integrate all of the different service business processes into a SOCOM process? And that's where we're seeing a lot of the issues when we go to the various J codes and they're like, ohh yeah, didn't, but it's never been addressed before. So while we've really overcome how, you know, the reason that SOCOM.Started for, you know, the operations and being able to communicate and collaborate across the different services.We haven't done that so much on the business side."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,I'm not surprised.
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"Mostly here at at.At the headquarters, we deal with some of the really the.What the four shops at the components in two socks and the eight shots? But that that's really.Yeah, we don't, we don't really deal with anybody else out in the components in tussocks."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"I I would say that we're not as proficient with data as I definitely out in the.Private sector.To include our.Our folks, government folks, as far as proficiency with with.More the data-driven.Aspects.Of of our organization trying to say that very.A very nicely."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"I I mean my my old staff didn't even know I had somebody that was like ohh, you know that the grids and I was like, what are you? It took me like 30 minutes to figure out she's talking about Excel."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"Yeah. So I mean, I had a staff that that didn't.You know, barely knew some functions within Excel and that was about it. So there's and I see that.In other director it's it was as well or divisions at least so.I I think we're not as proficient as.I'd like to see because there's so much that we can do with data.But we we we need people that have that expertise."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"So I'm gonna be honest. No, they don't have any interest. And I can say that with certainty because.I.The fight very hard to.Get Excel training for within softphone and while quite a lot of people have signed up for that training, it's a two day training over at JSOC in a couple weeks.The personnel that needed the most did not sign up."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,Yes it is.
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"Umm, I think most of them would stop at Excel. I personally am interested in a lot more. I know my new employee I recently hired would be extremely, you know would love to do that as well.I I will tell you I have 4 civilian positions, two of them retired."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"One of them resigned and one of them was in DC. I was bringing that billet back to Tampa and she wanted to stay in DC, so she resigned. So I went several months with no staff and I now have one staff member. So I'm on a hiring blitz because I've handled it all myself."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"No, they did not get taken away from me. They won't get taken away from me. I just haven't found anybody yet. I'm looking.For people of certain skill sets, and they're not out there, well, I haven't found them yet. How's that?"
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"I need people that have problem solving skill sets, program management.People that can think outside the box.And our results driven?It doesn't."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,I'm not sure if it's you know that.Because the the work that we do also had to have an accounting background or.Training and accounting like 24 hours of accounting college courses.
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"So, you know, having that combined skill set is.We find that a lot of those in DC I don't find as many down here in Tampa."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"Yes, it is because we're dealing with the financial statement. So it's bridging the financial statements out to the business processes and the field."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"Yes.Yes. So right now we have the, I don't know if you've heard of it, but it's the OSD NFR database that's probably it's part of the Advanta suite of products that they have."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"OK. And and part of that is we can SOCOM can build well we don't build it but.They would build an enclave for us to house all of our internal findings and our MIC program findings.And everything from the audit so that we could have that enterprise look at everything and working on building the fields and the mapping, everything that we need.And.I'm the only one that has the knowledge or background to be able to do that and.It's been waiting on me for.Several months.345 months because I just don't have time to get to it. But it's extremely important to our division to get it and our.All the reporting that needs to be done instead of doing the manual reports that we're doing it could all be done in the in that enclave.Umm."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"No, that's that's kind of what I have to build for it."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"You know how how everything should done flow through there and you know the approval processes and everything that needs to happen for that. But I don't have.Yeah, my my staff is new, so they don't have that information."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"Yes. And we're in our busy season, so.And everything that we're doing is new. So I have to train them on how to do it and then he's great. Once I can train him, he he runs with that and can handle that. My contract staff is new. So it's the same situation with them."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"So right now they're filling in for my.Well, it was for now. Three staff members that I'm missing, and then they're doing audit remediation. So they're working with.With our components to sock service providers to develop.Corrective actions that will remediate the issues and then in some cases they're helping actually work through. So if they need, they need a document, process, process documented, they would go in and document their process for for that division or whomever needed that. So they they are working directly with.The people in the field to help them remediate the issues."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,Yes.
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"Because it's really the people that are the me is in that particular area that are going to understand.Umm.And best.Know how to implement whatever fix needs to happen.Right. So it's really, really hard for me to come into your division and say, OK, I'm gonna write out this corrective action plan for you. Well, I I don't. I don't have the intimate knowledge of exactly what you do to be able to do that, but I can help facilitate that. I can ask the right questions to get you on the track to be able to develop that corrective action.That would fix the problem."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,Yes.
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,Yes.
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"So once I can sit down and map all of that out, they said they'll have it developed within 30 days and that includes the testing."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"So then once that's developed, then I have my contract staff will develop the tutorials and the training and then we've got a train light division, the ARMIK division. Then we have to go out to the field and start training. You know, the people that would be using the system.So rather than doing all of this work via e-mail, will now be in the system. It tracks everything. It doesn't lose any documentation, it's all in one place. All of the approvals, everything."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"Yes, I it sounds amazing. It was supposed to be in place a year and a half ago and we had a contract protest for a year and a half.That.That held that up."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,Yes.
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,Yes.
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,Now or are you saying in the future?
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"Umm.The same thing that I tell everybody is when you're dealing with systems.That makes sure you have everything you need up front, documented down to the end user that you've spoken to the end user.Got in there and put because.Once you design a system is very difficult. It's a more difficult to.Uh, fix any issues?Because if you don't have all of your requirements documented up front, you're not going to get what you need at the end."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"So I I just so you're aware, I do have my bachelors is computer science. So I did programming and web design in some a little bit of graphics."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"Yeah, I."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"Yeah, I've lost some of the terminology, but the concepts are all still there."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"Uh, so really? I've been working with all of this data and every aspect of this from the beginning. I've actually been the one that set up everything.So from the beginning.So I just I have the intimate knowledge of every aspect of how this works.The whole process and end."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,I did that as the contractor and then I moved into the division chief so.
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,The data culture in general is.Abysmal.Might be a little harsh.
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"OK.I was like ohh that's. Yeah it's there are so many manual processes.And manual data calls and so much that's done manually that there's so much room for error.My experience with the staff is.Data is not normalized. We're not understanding how important it is to.You know, garbage in, garbage out. So if you're not paying attention to the dashes and the spaces and and what you're putting in there.If the quality of the metrics that you're going to get is.Worthless at that point.Yeah. The we, we just don't have staff that understand the importance.Of data the importance of the quality of the data.And.How to?Make this not a a manual process.Like how can we use?SharePoint more effectively to take away a lot of these manual processes. I know there's ways to do it, I'm not familiar with SharePoint enough to do it, but from what I hear SharePoint has a lot of that that that that could be done.I was extremely interested in. Matter of fact, it's one of my goals to learn SharePoint a lot better because we use a lot. It's socom.Uh, this enclave. It's gonna take away most of everything that I need.Uh, because it'll have all of their reporting in the data and everything in there and we can build those standards reports and not have to do our manual reports.But even with all of that, SharePoint still fascinates me and I it's on my To Do List to learn.So I would say the staff that I have now and then building.Or will hire.Need to have that passion and the drive for data and learning how to use.Whatever tools are available to us to their full advantage.I.Yeah, I think it's just a waste of time. How much manual stuff we do."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"I think so, yeah. With knowledgeable people setting that up for them.Yeah."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"I think it's a lot of different things. I think, yeah, leadership doesn't have.My line of chain of command does have a we're highly data-driven highly.Umm.Technology driven, I would say is probably a better word. We love technology, we embrace it. Let's utilize it to its full potential. I don't see that outside of my chain of commands. So I know you had an interview with Mike Laws earlier. He is my boss."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"Work.Ohh, you probably don't even need my information because I know how much he talks.Uh.But he and I are lockstep on basically everything.Very rarely are we out of sync on anything so.Yeah, you probably gained more information from him than from me."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"Yes.That's awesome.Yeah, I miss coding a lot."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,But that's not where life took me.
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"So that's how weird story I.Was going for my bachelor's degree in in coding. Had that office job. It ended up we fired our outside accountants. So I did the book. It was really just bookkeeping. And I took it in house and that that just kind of started my path on this accounting career from one job to the next. And then it got to the point like, well.Looks like I'm staying in accounting, so I'll just go get my masters in accounting, which I have to tell you. It's very difficult when you come from a coding, you know background or bachelors.Switching lines was not very easy to do, but yeah, just kind of went that way and now I find like I can kind of bridge the departments and bridge the understanding, but I can tell you programmers.Don't like it when they find out that I have that background because I can call them on there. I'm like, oh, no, you can do that. You're like haha man, but that's really hard. Yeah, it is to that.So."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"Yeah, I love it. I love being able to, but I'm a Jack of all trades, so I love learning new things and if it's new and I have the time out. Ohh you're doing that, can I? Can I watch? Can I see what you're doing? Ask questions because I wanna learn it."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"God, if we could Master Excel and PowerPoint, that would put a monitor detector.Significantly enhance it and I know that's pretty sad in my estimation, but.I will be honest, I don't know what data.Products are out there that that would help the most.I just know that it's.I feel that has. I've wanted to get my hands into what it hasn't opened up that opportunity to learn more about it, to learn how it can help us. I just know that there's a lot more technology that could help us advance and be a lot more productive and proficient at what we do."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"Yes.Yes, I would, yes."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"I'd be the first one there in the front row.I'm not geeky, yes."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"When I talk, I'm not afraid to kick out. I'm not afraid to ask the stupid questions. I'll look stupid so people other people don't have to. And I'm OK with that."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"I'm not on the front lines, so I'm good."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"I wanna say it's more of my counterparts.And Mike's counterparts.And I don't know how you get.Old dogs don't like learning new tricks.Uh, and our pretty set in their ways. And so I I don't know how you bridge that.And that's that's one of the biggest areas that I see in SOCOM.Like, how do you?"
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"I've always done it this way and that's the way I wanna do it. That's the way I wanna continue. Do it. And I'm like, you're not gonna survive in my division. Move on."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,Hmm.
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"And I'm like, you need to embrace the future because all of this is coming and you know, it's all he. It's all here. You need to start embracing it. And that's kind of.It's one of the reasons that I actually jumped from contractor to government was I wanted to affect change.And one of the ways that I do that is embracing things like this and new projects and showing how it can be utilized better. I mean, from our staff agendas, you can tell mine has the pie charts and the."
"Foley, Lorrie A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",I actually.
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"Colors and I'm showing how data can be used differently. I I actually changed all of our annual review.Elements and standards I put in metrics put it all into an Excel spreadsheet through in all of the formulas my people can track how they're doing throughout. I mean, they don't even need me to be able to tell them that because it's it's all right there in that spreadsheet. It makes my annual reviews so easy. I've got the metrics to back it up because I track it all as well.Umm, I got the numbers. You know, of course I have to Add all of the subjective stuff in there as well, but it makes it so much easier for them. I've shared that with other division chiefs and they're like, oh, yeah, that's great. And nobody ever does anything with it."
"Foley, Lorrie A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Keep staring.
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"I'm like, but I keep sharing it because, you know, if one other person you know picks it up or one other person. So I tried to model that behavior for others and.So they can see how well.It works for another division and try and get them interested in that way."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"Yeah.Yep, that's it. I'm. I'm the only one that I see in manager meetings that brings my laptop to the meeting to take notes. They're all still taking notes on paper."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"I'm like, are you kidding me? We COVID was such a blessing. One, I love teleworking, but I I did a lot of my school work online.I we we now have laptops. You don't have to take notes on paper. You can do it all online and it's all filed."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"Yeah. No, I can. I can get that right. And how writing does that and that used to be me as well. And then I learned how to translate that into typing and I couldn't. I wish I could give you pointers on how, but as long as I'm typing it, it's now my brain is like my brain doesn't even wanna write anything anymore. I'm lucky to get my signature out and I have really clear handwriting. It's all of that. But it's. Yeah, I'm all about.Technology now, until it's my time on the weekend and then I'm like, yeah, I don't wanna look at a computer."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"My phone barely exists on the weekend, so."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,I figured nobody had at 24/7 access to me before we had smartphones. They don't need it now.
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,It's so bad.
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"I don't have any right now and but you know, if you're open to it and I have questions in the future, I would, you know, love to keep that rapport going and.You know, if you have like new initiatives or I don't know new something I I'm always wanting to learn. So you know I'll be there."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"Awesome. Thank you so much, Jessica and Victor, I I really appreciate your time for this. And you know, I know this is a lot of interviews and a lot of data that you're gathering and and I can't wait to see the results of it, to be honest.I'm excited."
"Foley, Lorrie A CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Thank you.
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,"Understood. Yeah. I can't even imagine how you put this desk for it.The spirit information together, but it'll be interesting to see so.Awesome."
144c1f5a-8385-410d-98ad-5b4c95a5a0bd,Thank you so much. You too. Take care.
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",I understand. I appreciate it.
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Ohh yes ma'am. I've been with some sofam since October of 2018, so it's been about four years now and my role with software, which is sofam investments is just that. I just I'm the actual integrator for on softphone and what that basically means is just that if there are any reports that are due out or report that we need from our financial information system, then they go to me to go ahead and pull these.Ports kind of like one of these reports in which I do on a quarterly basis. It's goes up to Congress. So I have to do what we call a congressional Financial Execution report. So I do those monthly and then on top of that, we have these monthly reports that I also do for the entire directorate.Or yeah, for the directory slash division forum saw from I. So I go into a financial information systems and I go through various other.Software or programs which we have within SOCOM that's financially related. So I've kind of like pull all those reports, pull them together and.And I put it together in which we call it something like a chicklet chart. So it shows what the financial status of our investments account are. And that's just basically it."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yes, it's it's reports which raw data which I pull down from the financial information systems, we have financial information systems within.Within the nipper side and then we also have the same on the zipper side.And then also I also use the. There's also a, UM, a financial execution module which they have over in self at and L so I pulled. I pulled those down as well too. I mean, those are raw data which I get from self at and L so we kind of like merge that merge merge the two reports together onto an Excel spreadsheet and put it on a pivot table. That makes it a lot quicker, a lot better for us to analyze about the financial health.Of of our organization, of our, or of the entire enterprise."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Oh yeah, yeah. I mean, at at first they're not, but initially when I built these report just a few years ago.So.It it was kind of like a little bit difficult because it is because with these Excel spreadsheets when I merge all those reports together, I kind of like built macros and a bunch of formulas. So initially it took a while it just to get together, but now it doesn't take too much time.I mean, there's still a little bit manipulation that has to be done, but nothing major.Can I share my screen with you? I I've got one up right now which I'm working on."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Alrighty.Are you able to see it now, ma'am?"
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Right, OK. Now see, because basically what I do is just that he was here. What the pivot tables. This is for the.The human appropriation, and this is for the RDT and E appropriation, which is the pivot table and this is kind of one of the reports. This is the Congressional execution report and what I basically do with this is just that one, there's that one database in which a pull.Uh, which I pull, pulled down from soft 18 Lac. It's called the financial execution module. So I am done download one portion from the FAM Financial execution module from AC and then the other one.Well, this one right here. I am kind of like pull down from the fist which is mainly coming from the Cipro side. So what I've done was just that I've kind of like merged both reports or both databases. When I download it into one.So it's it's, it's through a bunch of it's through macros which I created and also through formulas. Some of these actually has formulas to it.And that's kind of like basically kind of like what I do.Kind of like do this on a quarterly basis and there's something there's something similar to to it, which I do on the monthly basis as well."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yes. Yes, I'll, I like it better when it's automated. So it's like when I first built it it, it was complicated. It took me a while to see everything that I really wanted to see. So once I started doing it on a regular basis, it just got easier and not easier."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Oh yeah.
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yes, yes, it's something which I did on my own.So it's it's like I said, you know, came from this two databases I was I was able to go download it and then merge it into this one particular spreadsheet right here."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I can like learn this in my time with. Oh well. I was in the Air Force too, so I learned a lot of it back when I was active duty, which I retired in 2005. And then I brought it with me after I had retired. Cause I've been with USSOCOM since 2008.So there were other reports also which I've built when I was well, when I started at 2008, I was with soft AT&L.So I was with soft 18 helpful but for about a total of nine years.910 years and I created other reports for AT&L which some of those program element offices that they're using all the way up until now. So it's been quite a few years."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",So so even now that they still call me in case that they have any issues with somebody spreadsheets.
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yes.
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Well, that much I really can't tell you, Sir, because this goes all the way up to Congress when they see it. It it may it, it may change their decision based on the funding profile and what we did this year to all the future years budget."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Because Congress was the one that specifically asked for this. So since they've been getting it so far, I mean, I haven't received any feedback from Congress. We just started sending it to.To office of the Secretary of Defense Comptroller's Office. And they haven't really said anything about it. I mean, so I haven't really gotten any feedback, but there still requesting it."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, no problem.So this is kind of like one of the many things that I also do too. And and and then I have other.Other other spreadsheets that are or you know that are data-driven from the fist and from the fam.So those are the two systems which I basically mainly work off of and everything is downloaded onto a spreadsheet and then it does its thing."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","That's a it's it's a, it's another database that's that's manually fed by people in self ATL."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","This is going to be non attribution, correct?"
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","OK.Because the current system that they have in in feminism is not entirely accurate.I mean, because a lot of that stuff is I'm hand jammed and I'm going through that issue right now is just that some of their data which they put into the FEM does not match the data which which we take from the fists, which is the financial execution system.So.I believe that a T&L they're going through a process right now to obtain C cars. I know at one time that they were going to, but they didn't have the funding for it. But now I think that they may be. Don't quote me on this one, but I think that they probably looking at that possibility of purchasing C cars.I'm not sure if you know about that."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","OK, see cars. I'm not sure exactly what it stands for, but the most most of the Air Force, they're kind of like using that. And from my understanding, it's a very proven systems. It tracks all of the funding profile.Say for example we have procurement and RDT. Any appropriations research, development, test and evaluation. So what CC cars does is just that C cars actually cars actually tracks what our obligations expenditures and outlays are coming from different agencies, kind of like coming from the army coming from the Navy. But our FEM, it doesn't do that.The 18 Lac fam. It just doesn't do that, so they had to manually reconcile it."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yes, yes, they would have to manually enter it. That's that's just one issue which which about them, even though that we have to use the FAM data, it's we can't really rely on it, but we have to use it.Because that's kind of like one of the systems that you know that that that we have to use to go report that information and that's the problem in which I'm, excuse me. So that's a problem in which I'm having right now. I mean it's kind of like hard to reconcile hundreds of accounts compared to the 5th or the financial information system in which we have the Fiz. That's our main accounting system.And and then fists also. That's not very reliable as well too, because 5th, 5th is is. I think that's actually kept up by us here locally. But then there's a data warehouse that actually feeds into it, which is maintained by DFAS and other agencies accounting system. It kind of like goes into that data warehouse. And then we're supposed to kind of like or that fist pulls it down. However, there's going to be flaws with it.Because that's going to be, from my understanding, there's about thousands of of rejects before it hits our fist systems that would have that would have to be corrected before it actually hits our our system. So we're probably not reporting VM right numbers to them Congress and or to OSD.But then they have their own they have their own accounting system in which they have over there at OSD, and then which we don't even see."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, yeah. I mean, uh, perhaps other people and Umm sofam do, but I don't.I mean, you know, cause the case there are several divisions with them within sofam."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, it's, it's.I don't know it it it gets frustrating because you're dealing with all these different accounting systems and it doesn't match up with one another and sometimes it doesn't talk to each other.So we're not sure if we're, I mean I know we're not reporting the right the right numbers."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",So it gets it gets very frustrating. Ohh on on a on a on my end and how to explain that? I really can't say.
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Oh, OK. Yeah, yeah. So that's basically kind of like with the gist of it, I mean.It's it's just very frustrating. I'm going through that right now with that spreadsheet and what you just see."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Well, to tell you truth, ma'am, it's not really up to me to go fix. I'm just identifying it. I mean, before it even gets to me, it should have been fixed.There would be several offices that will be involved in getting corrected. One would be sofam M and then the other office would be soft AT&L Comptroller. They'll be the ones communicating that over to sophism to go get it corrected. And then sometimes we have desk analysts within sophomore I sometimes that they get involved.But all this should have been corrected before it comes to me, so I so right now you know this.I'm having to go through through somebody within software. I trying to find out exactly what we can do from you know, because right now.I don't want to send this report to I'm Congress if it's not right."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, and and I'm having a hard time trying to reconcile it.So I mean I I know it has, I know it has to go to Congress next week, but I'm kind of like I really don't wanna send it out or we can actually. I mean I I would hate to manipulate it."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I I think that we're moving forward. For one thing, there's a new system called advanta. And from my understanding is just that that's what OSD has. However, it's not right either because a lot of our data so Coms data is not being fed into it. So they're having to fix that issue now and then. Also from my understanding, it's just that there's gonna be a new program or new software that's gonna be taking in place of fist.On top of that, before we move to that new program, slash software, our there's gonna be a new data restructure which software M is doing right now and they're coordinating with us with other people within solve them and with soft AT&L.And from my understanding is the components as well. So we're going through those motions now and it's supposed to be coming online in 2025. I am believe it is. So we're gonna have a completely different data structure than now. We have now to account for all this funding."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Umm, I can't really do anything on my end because a lot of that is programmatic driven, meaning that's gonna be by self AT&L.I mean, because AT&LI mean because a lot of our proc and procurement funding and our research development test and and evaluation funding it goes directly over to South at and Lac and they're the ones that are the stewards of this funding. So they'll be the one depending say for example any kind of a weapon system, they'll be the one to easily identify it. And by what I mean by.Identifying it is to come up with a with a data structure for the one particular weapon system, so that way that we could account for all the funding from cradle to grave. So that's nothing which I can actually do that's gonna be up to soft ATL AC.Correct.Correct. Yeah. I mean I I could work with any data that they have out there just as long as as I understand it.Yes, just just as long as I know that this particular data structure belongs to this particular weapon system."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yes.
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","So my time with AT and really helped out, so I'll you know. So I was able to know from my time and I'm a T&L how the current data structure relates to each weapon systems.So my experience with HTML at at at it kind of like I won't say made it easier, it made it less challenging to go put this spreadsheet together.As far as the data goes."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","As far as the you know, doing the macros and the formulas, that's something entirely different."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Oh yeah.Yeah.
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I mean, it may take time a little bit of time, but yes.They will be able to know what the what the most current data structure."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Ohh yes definitely it makes a lot of stuff easier. I don't do a lot of them, but I don't do a lot of manual manipulation."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Well, let's just put it that way."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I'm sorry. Yeah, I mean it. It it makes it a lot easier. You know, you my years of experience working with the with the Excel, it just made it easier, I mean.Yeah. To where? You don't have to do a lot of manual manipulation. It's just trying to figure out. OK, you know each macro and then and then each each formula so.Umm, that's just about it.Makes it easier."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, ma'am.I I I learned a lot of this stuff on my own and trial and error and and from YouTube."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I'm. I'm. Yeah. I mean, there's there's a lot of resources out there, but I just learned that on my own."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Ohh yes ma'am.I would help out tremendously.I believe there is one that's gonna be up at J cell pretty soon, but sometimes is it that they and in this month or sometime at the sometime next month a couple of my coworkers, they were telling me is just that they want to attend the Excel training course that they're having over a JSON."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Just not sure what is going to cover. Yes ma'am.
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",That's the first time that I know of.
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yes, just two of my office that I talked to last week or the week prior, they said that they wanna go to that course. They're gonna cover pivot tables.A lot of the basic, I would say a lot of the basic stuff, yeah, it's it's a whole day."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",It is.
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I'm sorry, yeah."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Ohh yes ma'am it is. Especially when our director, Mr George Woods, when he would ask questions about certain programs.Within a within a T&L, then what they would do is just that they would either go off of them or they would go on the on the 5th and they all do their own analysis based on that data.And then if there are any additional questions which they which they need to answer Mr Wood's question, then they'll go to a T&L."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Correct.
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, ma'am. There's no one in that office right now.I mean, we have no one like that."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Uh, yes, ma'am. I think that would be very useful.Particularly not in our office, but probably in Sophism. That's where all the systems.Reside at, but as far as uh self am, I probably not.So that answered that question.OK."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, ma'am. It's just basically excel which I basically use for our all of our analysis."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, ma'am."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Ohh definitely yes.And that's the one which I'm saying that they're having issues with, I mean.Our data, our execution data is not feeding into advanta into advanta. I'm not sure what those particular issues are.I mean."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Right. And and then I'd like to deal along, you know, along with the system stuff.I mean whenever I can."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","What do you mean by that?I.Yeah.Uh, how can I put it? I'll. I'll. I would like to know more about what goes on and on about that side of the House. I'd like to know more on how that data feeds into our system coming in from ad fast. Only thing that they basically tell us is just that we have thousands of rejects.And other than that, we would ask why there's so many rejects that I'm clear. Jet. Ohh sorry.I got the ad hoc thing coming up. I'm not sure if you're if y'all get into that too."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yeah.
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","OK, so where was I at? I forgot. Yeah."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Or defense or or our local people. I mean, they would know, but they wouldn't tell us specifically why.It you know.It had rejected and then I said OK, I just leave it at that.Kind of frustrating but."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, no, I sure don't."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, I'm. I mean, because because one time, I know last year me and another desk analyst, you know we we would ask, OK, so there's thousands of rejects that are put into the system. Why is that so we asked the POC within sofam she says well we just haven't gotten a chance to go to go clear it. It says and I asked I mean.Why are there rejects and how come it's taking so long to unclear and basically what their answer was, you know is is just that we don't have time."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, yeah, I'm. I mean, I I just wish I knew more about the system and all in order to give. I don't know. I mean everybody out there, it's gonna have some kind of of useful inputs, but.I I guess we're just not the subject matter experts that that might be one of the reasons why.I'm I'm not sure."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","We have access, but somehow it's.I I would hate to say it, but sometimes a lot of them, they just don't want to give out.Those type of answers."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",I don't know.I really don't know.
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, ma'am, not at all. I think a lot of people would probably want to working on sofa MI."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Umm.How to work?Umm. Management.Yeah, I mean."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","They they got telework policies, but probably not as flexible as as a ours. And plus we got we have excellent division chiefs."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I mean, kind of like with with the the division chief I have right now he's he's very responsive to to whatever I have to say.So which is pretty good. It makes it worthwhile it just to just to stay within sofa mine."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yeah.
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yes.Porter is is is good with inside of my.
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, ma'am."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I guess in some sections they're probably have a lot more to do than in others.The only thing I know is, uh, I talked to some people within Sophie B. There was at a point in time, you know, during this past summer, you know, they asked if I wanted to go to Umm sofam be. I said, you know what, I was probably thinking about a change.And and and from South of my going to South from B. So I talked to other people within S MB and this says don't come.Don't go over.Well, it's it's they're saying that it's it's not a place to work. You'll be so busy and and.That's just about it. I mean, you just be so busy, so don't come over. You won't like it.That's."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","OK. Yeah, that's what they told me since I was thinking about, you know, trying to expand my career, going from from the investments branch.To the O&M branch, I you know, I I I think that will look good for my career. But after talking to them, this is yeah, you don't want to I'm and they're saying that people are leaving and people don't want to apply for those positions there other people within soft foam or within a HTML they don't wanna apply within self thumb.Because because of internal issues.But that's what I was told. I said OK, we had it. I'll just dropped it."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yeah.
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Additional development, yes, there's there's always gonna be that opportunity.They they they do encourage it. Management does encourage it. Both our director Mr Woods and my division chief. So then yes, they do encourage it. I just got to take advantage of it."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","However, between.Between me and you, my super my current supervisor knows about this. It's just that although I do like it and I'm sofa my, but I think I could probably grow more and that's why I took a job with self at now. I'm working in the Budget Office."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yes, I'm leaving stuff on my soon. I start with a T&L.In the 20th of November."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Thanks. They've been trying to get me over there for the past three or four years.
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Uh, uh. I'll be working over there at the Budget Office, so it's something new. Before I used to work at the program Element Office.So yeah, I know that this past summer there, there were about two offices that that were. So they're sitting my help on those spreadsheets which I created for them so.That's just about it. So I'll be a lot closer to them now. So they just could reach out and touch me since I'll be in the Budget Office."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. And then also it's kind of like the best of both worlds too, since, you know, since I've worked in sophomore, I got that I had that experience there and then got the experience within self Atml control office. So it just kind of like the best of both worlds because a lot of that stuff in which they do, they do in self Amaya as well."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Not yet. That's what that they wanted to talk to me about.
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","They might have an issue with that, cause a lot of people there they're they're not.A lot of people there, they know what I do and a lot of them.Are very hesitant to take on what I do because of all because of all the macros and and the formulas that that I use, they're not confident.And.A lot of them, just they, they're just not confident in their Excel skills.I am trying to help him out as best as I can."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yes.
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I'm pretty sure that I still get the phone calls for the first few months, but other than that I then then I think it should, you know, actually allow some."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Right, yes."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","We're Umm sofam I I would think kind of like a Cellcom as a whole. I think bringing on sea cars would would probably.Make things a lot easier.You know, I mean it's a very proven system on why SOCOM, after all these years, I'm why they don't have it. I I mean, but I understand it's because of the funding.I mean it's it's it's not one of our higher priority items, but hopefully that they'll make it a a priority one of these years.I mean, I've I've talked to a lot of people at AT&L and within some people within sofam.You know, they they really like the, Umm, system. It will make our jobs a lot easier. I mean, as far as looking at the weapon systems, the overall financial health of the weapons systems and everything else, it would be a lot better than the FEM, which a lot of them is hand jammed anyway."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. So that's that's just about it. I mean, it's just with them. I'm see cars. I I think that will make a big difference. Already talked to a bunch of people from both sides, AT&L and I'm sofam. They would love to have C cards come online."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, it's just a matter of funding, that's all. I mean, I could understand that."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yes.
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",What advice can I give my replacement on a lessons learned?
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. One of them is, uh, they should. Well, if they don't already know, just, just, just be aware of of the data that's coming in from our current financial systems, like the FEM and the 5th.Hello I'm question the question, the data that's out there or if you can't answer it, go to one of the one of the desk analysts.I mean, you know, there are, there are other avenues to go to go research it, don't I? I mean that's kind of what I've done in the past. I've gotten frustrated, you know, trying trying to find some of that information myself when I should have gone over there to the desk analyst when they will probably know it better than me."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Correct. Yes, exactly.Yes."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, that's what I'm saying. You know, that's what that did there for leverage it that that's a perfect word for it."
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Thank you. Hopefully I didn't ramble on and on. I got a habit of doing that.
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",All right. Thank you. Thanks for having me. Appreciate it.
"Gruta, Fernandel O CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","All right, you too."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. And the chief of the rate based programs in Sofam, I manage the building of rates and execution.And well, programming, budgeting and execution for the Flying Hour program and SIF pay programs."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Since 2008.
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Well, for the for the Flying hour program.In the.In the palm, we pulled in execution data.Uh, we get information from DASA CE.The Air Force afag.Afsoc uses sock.And.And OSD.In the forms of PCB's and pitons.And we compile all that information to build rates, cost per flying hour rates.Umm. And then.We also get information.From AFSOC and Usasoc in regards to their flying hour requirements by platform.For.Or building the hours, we multiply the hours times the rate to to produce a dollar requirement.We also manage the inventories.Uh, so we have inputs for mathsoc usasoc.And sofa ATL.To.Manage the inventory for all aircraft.On civilian pay, it's it would be all components.For actual execution.And then of course OSD inputs for rates.Inflation factors, that is and.That's.That's really the the inputs that we receive.That answer your question."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","So we we create the rates and the hours they go into the.Palm the.Program objective memorandum.Umm. In the budget cycle we we produce the total resources requirement in terms of hours, rates and dollars.Or the for all aircraft in the in the.Program budget review.Uh, and then in the president's budget submission to Congress.Umm on the civilian pay side is the same the the PBR and the best.Uh, we we produced the.Uh.Rates for each.Uh civilian each component and each.Sag or?Subject Activity Group grouping the rates for each one of the components and sags.Umm. And multiply that by the number of work years to produce a requirement in terms of dollars for the.Palm PBR and and the budget."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",It it.
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yes, it is manual process monthly reporting manually.Umm. Or on the aircraft side it's it's.Hours falling and dollars executed.By commodity.And on the civilian peace side, it's it's.Uh work years executed as well as UM.Obligations in various types of of pay.There are many, many categories of pay."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Uh, yeah, we we continuously have issues with with the data. It's a, it's a manual process and the turnover of of civilian pay.Uh and analyst at at the components of lends itself to.To extensive review each month to accurately.Get the details because we're comparing that.To uh.Different accounting systems that that each component utilizes."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","So.Yeah, due to the headquarters reductions, I've lost the civilian pay execution analyst, so.I I'm not sure how we're going to review execution for civilian pay. It's it's gonna. It's gonna.Be hiddenness, certainly.Umm and.It's it's a labor intensive on the.Flying our side as well because it's not just getting the information that's not the problem, it's it's analyzing it, determining.Is it following the?The budget request that we sent forward, so we need to.Accurately predict in the budget request what we're going to fly or what civilians we're gonna execute and then.Uh, we have to then interpret that data as it comes in.So that we can understand why we deviate from the request that we submitted."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","So.Yeah. Yeah. We continuously have a RFI's from.Uh, namely from the professional staff, members of of Congress.In, those typically occur after the president's budget is submitted, so in the spring time we're answering a lot of rfis.Asking about our execution to date. So we're we're reaching out, pulling a lot of information for that. Occasionally we also get.Umm, out of cycle request from Cape?Uh.Typically it's Cape asking for inventory of air aircraft.And execution.Numbers for those.The CB22 is a good example. It's managed by the Navy. The program office is.It it runs the the CV 22 is is a Navy office so they.Have out of cycle request a having to do with the hours form of the CV 22. So we get we get quite a few auto cycle type.Things for for hours inventories.Umm. And and civilian execution from, namely congressional staffers."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, we we were able to utilize the the data that we have because we we do it monthly. So we have the latest.Ah, ah. You know, in the months of information that we are able to to send forward."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, yeah. Sophie, till now we we interact with them.Both pushing and pulling information from them. J8 is the main driver of the palm and and.We are.Continuously working with them really throughout the year.Uh, as we as we roll into the the palm cycles.It's a lot of.Well, we we maintain the Hyperion.Database for the flying our programs to pay amount for G8.So those are typically the two.Umm Jay codes that we interact with J3.Occasionally it's more. I mean, it's not a lot of system, you know interaction, but we we trade information with the J3.Or readiness uh, type questions as well as.Having them review inputs that we get from the components regarding the hours requirements of the aircraft."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, we have a.We haven't mapped that out.Really, we do have regulation that covers the the roles and responsibilities, but the actual.Information flow.Not, not really. Now we do have.A flying hour in a sippy sippy modules that we've built within Hyperion.And we've.Worked with Sofam to to lay out those process flows with our you know the database where we where we have the repository of the information.So we do have have those."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Umm.No, there are no metrics as far as.Efficiencies of of our processes."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Umm.Within my section or or.OK, I'll."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","OK. I think first of all we need a.We need a database that that actually.Is.That we're able to interact with more of effectively.That the Hyperion.Database.Ohh is constantly you know having to.To have workarounds and fixes to.To store the data, I think we have the.Modules working pretty well.But now I'm hearing that this is all gonna change where we're getting another one now. So. So I don't know. It's we'll we'll see how that that works the.The other piece is the accounting systems. It would be great if those accounting systems would roll into what we what we have is the fists, the financial information system that's supposed to pull from each of the services, accounting systems and give a.Yeah.Obligation status, but it would be great if it also pulled.Other information it was accurate, such as work years executed for civilians as well as all the different pays that that are logged in in each of the legacy accounting systems.The.And then on the flying hour side, there is no central repository of ours and obligations.Uh, you know that's.Why we have to do this manually? Because there's no.DoD wide system that that captures all of this information. So I guess how would sum it up and say and it'd be great to have a?DoD wide system that would capture obligations. Hours.Work years all the.The information that we utilize."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely. And I know you know, OSD is working on that. Bona. I'm sure you've heard that that term, this supposed to be a management information system that will capture this.And again I.You know, I've seen these systems come and go.OSD has.Has historically tried to capture things in in systems and.Has yet to.To get one that that will.Or actually provide accurate information without a lot of manual interface."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Umm.Well, first, there is no singular accounting system in DoD. Each service has their own, so.So you know you're trying to convert.All of these this information into one.Uh.Type of information and it's just.Uh.Until you get a a singular accounting system, I don't, I don't think.You know, we'll see any any marked improvement and.And providing.Senior leadership with any anything that.Uh, such as advana that will provide.Real time information.Uh, without?Huge manual interface to to translate.Each.Unique.Accounting system to to a standard.Knowledge base."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","And you're fading in and out there, Victor."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yeah.Right.
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","And and and really, there's no, I mean, there's nothing SOCOM can do because these are OSD driven systems, so.I'm you know, we're on the receiving end of of these of these systems and and will continue to.To work. Uh.Work with what we have."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Umm.Yeah. So we, uh, every it's been monthly. Now we do Vice Commander, budget execution reviews with with the USO CON vice commander.Uh, where we provide.Execution information in the form of of PowerPoint and charts.We.Also do that in the budget rollout time frame.For for the.Uh congressional staffers? Both the.Authorizers and the appropriators.And then.We also provide.Various, you know, presentations throughout the year to.To different audiences, whether it be in to components.To show their execution status.Uh or to?The J8 assessment directors leadership there to show.Execution and programming and in budgeting comparisons so we do provide various.Uh presentations and these are.Manually derived from information extracted from.Yeah, the Hyperion database various.Position budget positions within the database and we transcribe that into into PowerPoint presentations."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Umm.Will.So.I guess when we provide that to the JA, there's decision points on what levels we will fund programs at.So that would be the probably the biggest, the one that leads to the biggest change then we we take those decisions and then apply them as we move forward through that specific program, whether it be the palm or the budget.So that's those are the ones that provide the biggest change or the?The.Presentations we give to the J8.During the palm process."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","And so often.Well, there's, there's the typical.Training classes that are offered for.Or excel.And and.Our analyst within within Sofam.Typically our our limited to the Hyperion database.So.Utilizing that which is an Oracle based.Database which you can do extractions of of information from that and put it in Excel, but that's pretty much the.The expertise and the limitations is is pulling it out of the database, dropping it in Excel and manipulating Excel and.You know, to be Frank, probably the.The most.Utilized.Data manipulation is probably.Pivot tables.So I don't see analyst utilizing.Access databases or any any tools of of that nature to further manipulate.Information. It's mostly, I would say, spreadsheets.Yeah."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, absolutely. It would be great to.To.Offered that, I think it would be.Good to.See maybe.What what analyst is doing and then maybe offer tailored training to that more than just the, you know, the standard pivot table training or something?Maybe see were.An access database could be used or or some database where.And then offer training to to actually build.Useful.Data manipulation tools."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Sure.
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, I think it'd be more of this to me, hands on.Training.Because.The senior level. Uh.Looks like.Especially within financials, you you can't really throw that out there without a lot of caveats, so.I think.Having it at the lowest level possible with the most detail.Being able to to.Different differentiate and and pull things out and and and manipulate data as is where we need to to be and where we would benefit the most so that we can.Uh.Divided up and and provide.Yeah.Senior level type information.That that's that's our, that's been vetted and and."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","So it's verbal. I mean, we set them down, walk them through. Ideally you you have overlap, right, so.You can train them up with the current person in the job to.To have some some OJT and and and train a mob. But and and typically, I mean, we're here to headquarters level, right? So the person coming in should have a vast amount of experience already. Yeah, and knowledge in.What we do, so they would be able to sit down and and hopefully bring ideas in with them that that we could benefit from."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. Yeah, so.Our speaking just for my sections we do have.That in the database manipulation is one of the elements, so they have to be.Current, knowledgeable and accurate in.But not only data input, but.Data.Uh manipulation in the in the database retrieving, providing reports, timely and accurately, so it is. It is one of the.Elements of.Of the appraisal system."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, a little bit. That's OK. It's extraneous noise. Sorry."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Umm.So typically the.The folks that we get in do have the ability to to pull information and work in the databases. I see it more as their ability to analyze.Umm, and ask the you know the questions of why is this information here what's causing it?Why is it differing from what we previously had? Those type of skill sets?So simple and if there's a system that can help them do that, that's that's great. But but just recording.And extracting information.Is uh.It is not enough, it's it is requires.Umm, actually analyzing the the information and I think that's where the systems really help is being able to pull the information quickly so that you can do that analysis and you can go and and pull.Umm, different positions in the database quickly.Umm and easily. So that's where.In my mind.Data needs to be readily available and easily pulled so that an analyst can.Can do it with relative ease and then not be precluded from doing it because they can't get me the information."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, I I think so at all levels.In in Sofam beat, I mean we're based on information, right on on data entry. So we have.Accounting system that that is the repository for all of our obligations and we have a a Hyperion database that is the repository for our programming and our budgeting. So we don't really do anything.Outside of of those two systems, I mean the we're we're pretty much bound to working within systems, so.Yeah, our.Our environment lends itself to that and I think from.From our ES level down to the analyst level.We we embrace.Data and manipulating it and trying to.To find better ways of of.Having flow the flow of information flow more freely and more accurately.Overall."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No. So I guess my only question is, so when you get all this, all these interviews done, what is the ultimate goal here of?Of the.Uh.Data maturity.What do you plan to do with it all?OK."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. Yeah, it does, yeah. My only.Little concern is.We live with within an ever evolving.Ohm systems that are, you know, pushed on us.From OSD level.So.Umm.Whatever.Portland defense determines is gonna be a new system or a service changes their system or whatever.Will affect.How we manage that information flows and and so.I guess architecture integration is sure would be the.The domain that seems to be very challenging."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yeah.
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yeah.
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, yeah, that that's good to hear, because in my mind, that's kind of the what I was thinking is he, you know, if you're gonna establish.OSD if they can establish standards that gives you your left and right.Limits and standards for inputs and outputs, and then you plug into those rather than than getting systems forced on you that that.You have to adapt to.I guess I I quit it to standards and information architecture for.Uh, information flow, you know like."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","And as long as you it you're building to that standard, then you will be able to talk. So, so.Yeah, yeah."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Oh good.
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Alright. Well hey, I'm good talking with you guys and if you."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Any follow up or anything just please reach out.
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","OK, you too. Thanks a lot. See you."
"Lane, Joseph C CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Uh.
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Now I understand your your intent. Uh, I did have some questions as we go through the questions that were provided to us and the e-mail, but my Denny."
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",No questions at this time.
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I have been at Soflam since June of 2022, so just a few months and the major role that I play is I am the integrator within the Sophon B branch.So I integrate the.Information the data that is input into the OSD database from the SOCOM databases.And basically we get.The information that is put in for the palm.For the best for the PBS.And we ensure it looks right with the other analysts and then put it into the OSD database.Over."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","So we have data calls for, for example, our overseas contingency operations. We do a data call that's all given to us off of a spreadsheet from the component and then we take that and we put that into the SOCOM database which is Hyperion.And then we take the information from Hyperion and we put it into the Ng RMS, which is OSD database.Though that's an example of how one of those data calls works."
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","So I've got here at the end of July, so just over four, 3-4 months and I worked for kernel Lynch. So pretty much I back her up and do the other the same tasks as she does if needed. So putting the information into the database, collecting it and then I also use the data to compile lessons learned and any output slides or reports that we have to provide with that data."
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",We're we're working on that being one of the major outputs we we're not quite there yet.
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Uh.
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No decimals.No. So we we are the integration branch which is me and major Denny. We are a brand new section that was.Up about.Uh, I was coming here so they weren't even sure what they wanted to do with us, so we're kind of charting our own territory.As."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. So we we're trying to figure out how they want to use this.Cause a lot of things.Reach between the formulation side of the B branch and the execution side of the B branch. So making sure that both sides are talking the same language and that our story transcends from the future years because we build budgets five years in advance. So are we staying the right story and is that truly making its way down to the execution side? Do they understand what we were saying, why we were saying it?And is there something that the execution guys know that?To that should have been, should have been known, you know.Before, as we were building for the future, is there something they know that we that we should have done so kind of bridging that gap?No, that's why room just we're trying to figure things out right now. And Major Danny has is doing a good job at working those lessons learned, but.I know one thing I learned was no decimals because that really was frustrating during the best."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yes. Oh yeah, in the major. Denny brought up the templates. Tell her about that major day."
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, it's developing templates for the data inputs that we have to put into the Ng arms to make sure that everyone's using consistent and same.Like values and formulas and inputs because we would get one spreadsheet one way from another one person and then a a separate spreadsheet from a different person, formatted completely different, and some people were missing data elements. Some people had additional data elements and then figuring out which data elements we actually need. So that's what we came up with, was developing templates of what we need so we can put it into.The OSD database has its required and then also like some of the lessons learned obviously is is identifying the key players early to make sure like hey if we need someone from the components to be involved, who is that POC and at what level do they need to be involved and then across the different at least internally to us for soft foam. If there's someone in software B someone sofom I someone in softness who's that POC and at what point do they need to be involved to make sure that everyone on the same page?"
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Like I said, everyone was doing their own, uh spreadsheet or tabulation of what they thought needed to go into the database and then.The nice thing is it engineer miss is a new system, so we can start from scratch and then we can.Build it how we wanted to build versus some people had done the old system and they were used to doing a certain way or just passed down of. This is how we always done it and well that's not maybe not necessarily the best way to do it or that's not the information that's now needed for the new system.While that was information required for the old system or the new system, this is the only the information we need."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Well, within Jarmus being brand new were the really the only ones that know how to play in it. So the whole that's not always needed before I'm like, OK, well this is a new system. So this is how we need it now and they're kind of.They're having to trust us. That's kind of nice.So we don't, we don't get a lot of pushback when I say well, this is how we need it and and so the the more that they get into it and we want them to get into it and play with it more. But we're so busy, it's hard for them to get in there and play with it.But we're the ones that really do the data data input. Not many people get in there and do the data input like we do.So in the components, don't use it at all. It's just here right now with us."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Right, us. And then Erma Anderson and her team.And then I think sofam S gets in there and sees the stuff and sofam I gets in and sees it, but we do the actual data input for O&M."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, but like menu said, having the having a standard template is crucial. We've noticed because we get templates that are so different. We're just like, Oh my gosh, what is so telling us?"
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, we've got some for the PB that we've created that we're gonna actually provide them tomorrow.Because the PCB's kicking off and we're gonna give them a little, here's our SharePoint site. Here's where you go to find a DCR. Here's where you go to find the OPS 32 template with everything that we need on it. I don't care what spreadsheet use offline in your little world that you want to do it, but you will copy and paste whole numbers into this particular template and that's how you'll give it to us for the data input.Ohh.It's just."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yes, yes.And then are eventually our hope is that we will train them how to pull their reports, how to look at their reports. But again, between the best and the PB, it's just been super busy. And I know that after the PB, we're gonna get RFI's. That's a whole another level from Congress. And then but summer time, well, just before the best kicks off is kind of slow. So hopefully we'll be able to do a little bit more training and all that stuff, so.Just never stopped around here."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Well, not the components. I don't know what the plan for the components is because the components don't have ngrams."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, no, the I don't know what the plan is to get the components all this stuff.But right now it's just at the headquarters level. We're just working on our our fellow office mates."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",I honestly don't know if the J8 has it or not.It was ruled out the day I got here. It was the day it was getting rolled out.So.
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",And it isn't.
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yeah.
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","It's an OSD system, so yeah, I'm not sure if they go into it, not if they go into it or not."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. And this is just one of the OSD systems, because we and our mess was supposed to replace PRCP insist, but we still have to go into SYS to find out if Ngrams agrees with this.Which is another OSD system that we have. So we have. Yeah, it's it's a lot. But before we can even populate in Jeremy's, we have to make sure that we update everything on Hyperion first.So Hyperion, which you know is so comes out of base has to be populated and done and balanced and then we take the Hyperion database information and put it into engrams.So we have to do 2 databases for every single drill."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yes.
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Well.That's that's a tough one.Because of what we do.It's kind of split.Because.The palm itself and the J8 went, runs the palm and they have to come compile that information and that takes time all the time in the world.And then once they passed the palm to sofam, our guys look at it and make sure that the financial side of it is correct. I used the right code, set it sitting in the right area that it makes fiscal sense that they didn't put something where, you know, you spent $10 one year. Now you're gonna jump and spend 50 million in the next year. That makes no sense. So we just have to make sure that it's making fiscal sense and that it wasn't put in the incorrect PE. It wasn't put in an incorrect sag.Kind of stuff.Umm, so that's the reconciliation of that area that the JA should should.No.Had a.And then we have to.Once that.And.Then they put it in German. So I would say it's probably.It's really both cause then we get to the PV and we get pita, EMS and PD.And we have to spend the time.Getting the correct information for those. What programs are gonna be impacted getting that information back? What are we gonna do to to fund it? What? What programs? Lost money getting that updated in the system and making sure that we balance bottom line again. So it's really it's really kind of split.Hope Hicks.Yes."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. And it's, I mean, it can be.It could be the one to two months during the summer time for the best for us and FM, but you know, months on end for the J-8 with the palm. Or it could be the months on end for us starting in November, going all the way up until like last year till April for the PB, which should stop in February."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, because the PB is due the presidents budgets do the first Tuesday in February, but.Yeah. So it's it really depends."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Major Daniel, that you start that one."
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Ah.So the answer is we can always use more people, right? That's the that's the that's the textbook answer.Umm.I I think you know right now we have to get people trained on the new on what we need for the new system and then also I know there's a couple of analysts that we positions we have open that needed to get filled. If we were at full capacity, I think it would, it would be good but.That's where we have it. Is it like myself and and kernel inch coming in new we're we're trying to learn the new system as we're going along and then trying to teach the what the requirements are to the other people that's also challenged so.Hopefully after we get one or two cycles on our belts, we'll we'll have it all figured out and then they'll change the system again for us."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I would say uh. As for the training, I was lucky. I've I did this particular job for the Air Force 20 years ago, so I had the basics down. I understood the the palm, the PB, the process. I did the database before for the Air Force level. So I understood how it was supposed to work. Somebody coming in cold Turkey that didn't know that.Would be. It would be a challenge.So all I had to really do was learn a new database and that's fine.So, and no, there's really no training besides getting in there and just doing OJT.For for this side of it.Like Major, Danny is correct. We we are a office that has been eaten alive.When it comes to to bodies, so yeah, we need. We need people and they they need to be trained.It's just finding the time to train them."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I would say it is. You are thrown into the fire and you go cause Major Denny arrived.During the best right, Major Danny. Yeah, during the best. And it was. Hey, here. Go put this in."
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Umm to two statement. Yes, I got here in August, late July, early August and it's like OK well, I need to put this in the databases like but I don't know how to do anything in this database. There was one training provider that.I think had I had a foundation, it would have been alright, but it was more like an overview and I didn't know where the system was pulling the information from or what it was doing and.Uh, like a good Air Force officer, figured out and and we we moved on. But yeah, some sometime.Later on, I would like to get a better understanding of.Why and how?And then it will click and make sense for me, but.Being short handed and.Having to do that drill when I got here and and having a deadline there just wasn't the time to do it at that point in time."
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","So that so there are several. So obviously Hyperion has maintained by soften and there's people that maintain it so they.Can provide us the training on the database. We just need to set the time apart to do it and for them to schedule the training and make sure it's conducive training that.Umm. Kind of answers what we're looking for and then there is some NGR mess training. But right now the ngrams training kind of is only training for what is ahead of us, not the overall system itself. Like, OK Hey, we're working this piece of ngrams inputs, that's what we're training on, not overall the system. And this is what the system does and how the system does it and and why you do it in this system, it's just.You have to enter the 24 PB. We're gonna do 24 PB training and then.It's the next thing we're gonna train on. The next thing."
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Exactly.
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Those positions fall in another section that works with us with an FMB.Uh, I'm sorry. Within cell phone B.Umm, my understanding is.That doing formulation is a hard skill to find.Not a lot of people are exposed to the formulation inside of the budget.But there's also some political stuff going on.I stay out of that."
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","So so I think I think we would benefit and I know what a previous command at Ucom where I was at, we started to get into power BI. I'm not sure if you are familiar with Power BI but having that dashboard and then having that in front of you and actually having different ways to display the data that makes sense. I think that would be very helpful for some of the different sections within software and probably within SOCOM if we could.Umm, get that up and going. Power BI with the different visual, the analytics and the information. I know there's a lot of back end work on where pulling the information from. How do you manipulate it and then how to get display properly but once you have those dashboards set up they're super intuitive and easy to use. And I mean Commander looking at the dashboard can see like hey, if I'm supposed to be paying this amount and I'm paying this amount I'm red. How do I get back to being green?So that's something I know I wanna get smarter on. Is is power BI and and how I can incorporate that into this job here."
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, I have not."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","We've heard about them, but we haven't been involved with them."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yes, yes, yes. How do we get that?"
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yes.
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Oh, thank you."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",I do.
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",I think they do wanna.
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Go ahead.
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I think they do wanna see it. And and you know, we can all prepare spreadsheets and give them spreadsheet but that doesn't tell the whole story or that doesn't provide a good pitch or so if there's different or better ways to provide the information from the spreadsheet, more visual or that actually tells a story, I think that's what they're looking for is great. James, you gave me a number. You gave me a bunch of numbers on the spreadsheet, but what does that mean to me or what's the impact of that? So if there's better ways to display it or show it or to put a little more meat.Behind those numbers to like, hey Sir, this is what this number really means. And this is what what we need to do or why we need to improve this number or I think that's that's what they want is they want us to do some analytics on it and provide them those key decision points that can go with that analysis and what the importance of that is."
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, we're we're definitely thinking about how like when like this one where we're building the 24 PB, how we can build that and provide those impacts and and what the.What that has potentially impact in future years of if this is done or that's done, so yeah, we we we do think about that and how we can make it better and how we can provide some good solid analysis behind the product that we're preparing."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","The problem is, I always find myself spending more time preparing the data to show things versus having the data.Spun around and being shown faster so that I can do more time on the analysis that makes sense."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yes, that that is that is the biggest challenge that I I have and I'm not the brightest thing out there, but.That could be part of the problem too."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I don't know what's out there that supports that, so I don't. I don't know much about that."
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yes.
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yes, learning that because I think just at the common person out there knows how to work. Excel knows how to work a spreadsheet, but what's out there that can manipulate those spreadsheets? I mean, I just learned how to do pivot tables when I got here, so that's I think I'm pretty darn quick now, but.But I know I'm not, but I'm just now. I'm in. So I'm I think I'm pretty good with the pivot table now, but what else is out there that can help me manipulate that data quicker? So I'm I can do the analysis, spend more time on that analysis than spending all that time on the preparation of the data."
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, exactly. So I know yesterday we did an Excel course and they talked about macros. So if we could develop macros that we just provide the data and it spits out the end product and instead of us trying to format and do it all every single time, if we have the same data every month, every quarter we can.Go towards that, put in the macro and then blink it so it pops it into whatever the PowerPoint that they need or.Like I said, if it advances the system where power BI it displays on the dashboard automatically instead of us spending hours on end trying to put in the presentation, that would be really helpful. So learning what's out there and how to kind of do some of those things that would that would be helpful for us."
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Is more of an introduction. They showed us like a basic macro like how to record.But actually not how to go in and.Uh.What does she call it? Like program or type? So like I can like you could record it in Excel and that could be your macro and you could save that as a button. But as far as programming it then that's a little more intense. We did not cover any of that.
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I think there is appetite out there. It the concern comes, will leadership support it because of the high tempo that we have in other tasks that are out there.Because we did have other people signed up for this class and leadership said, no, you can't go because I want things you have to do. That is the the problem that we face is we have these great things that we as workers want to do to make it better for us to be able to support leadership and what they're looking for. But then when they come around for us to actually go and do it, leadership doesn't support it because something else is now taking priority.So this needs to be a priority for us to be able to go and learn how to.You know, manipulate our data faster so that we can get the analytics done faster.That it needs to be a priority and leadership has to understand that."
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. So obviously there's an opportunity cost, so.Is it better to have the opportunity cost at the front end where OK, we don't dedicate our our time to this task so we can learn these skills. And then on the back end, those skills that we learned will make those tasks go faster or is it?You just do the tasks and you never learn a new skill and you're just constantly trying to stay above water."
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yes.
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","And I mean, when you look at the Department of Defense and you look at our civilian counterparts outside of the DoD, we are light years behind.On what they're able to do.And why is that? Have they invested more time in their employees?To develop their employees to be able to do.What they do, I I don't know.But they're their ability is just it's incredible. And what they are exposed to. I I don't understand why we aren't able to to be at that level."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Oh, goodness, that's a tough one."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","She said that first I have all this time to think about it.I guess once I have.I don't know.When I pull a report out of.The system that I pull it out of AT and James, I have to formulate, format it the same way every single time. So I'm sick of formatting it the same way every single time.I would want it to know that I'm pulling it and just format it the way I want it formatted."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",I just be smart enough and just know that I want it for it this way and stop forming it the way you want it formatted. Do it the way I want it done.It.
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","It exports just a ton of data, just a ton of data, a huge Excel spreadsheet, and then I have to format it the way I need it done.For how I want to look at it.I just. I just wish that it would know based off of the fact that I'm signed into it.That that's the way I want it done."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I wish there was a way that I could, you know.Choose Naires report and then it would just OK. This is how she does it.So.But.Major Denny."
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I mean, I think mines a little hard, you know, I guess just getting leaderships general expectation of what they want to see on the data and how they want to see it. But I realize that always changes because they're being asked different things from Peter congressional inquiry or different Cocom wants to see a different way. It's just I guess having that clear lines of communication with leadership of what they need on the data and how they expect to see it I guess.Up front and and not hopefully at the last second, but I know that's unavoidable."
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",No problem. You're welcome.
"Ziebert, Nicholas K CTR USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Hayden, I have nothing now. Thanks a lot."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Were we the fastest interview?I'm just playing.Oh my goodness.Hmm.
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","You could have just said we were the best, but OK, that works."
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I don't have anything we did any of you good.Advanta, yes."
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, I don't have anything else. I know you had mentioned maybe sending us a link or some training or somewhere. Advanta. Yeah, if that if you could send us that, that would be greatly appreciated. So we can take a look at it."
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",All.
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",I am definitely interested in that. Thank you very very much.
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Alright, thanks."
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Alright.
"Lensch, Nyree D LTCOL USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Alright, you too. Bye bye."
"Denny, James K MAJ USAF USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Alright, bye."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Help them in preparate preparing our financial statements.Uh, sorry, I'm getting a message. Hold on."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","OK. So yeah, that's the message that I received, OK.Umm so again, just working with Deep Pass to get our financial statements generated. Any on top adjustments that need to be done based off off the review of the financials.Our trial balances and then putting together our footnotes and he.Uh. And detailed disclosure and information that needs to be input into those. So that's my primary high level.Position and what I do."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Yes, yes you can put it that way."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Well, most of the information that I use currently it it comes from the various accounting systems.Umm, you know and our our data is basically an all of them since we are met the military services.Uh accounting systems so.That information is fed up and and a summary to D fast, and they do all of their processing of that data.Umm. And to the reporting systems.DRS and creation of our trial balance and then the subsequent creation of our financial statements and footnotes.So I used that information at tribalance drill down, which again is still summarized.To be able to perform any high level reviews of our information, our data.There are instances where I'll need more detail.Specifically, to be able to answer the question of trends or fluctuations of when comparing different accounts to the current year and the past past fiscal year.So that's where my hang up has been. We've not been able to get that lower level detail or anyone at that field level to be able to let us know that information so that we can include it in our footnotes or to respond to the auditors with that information."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","No.That's what the advanta was going to be able to do.Or is the how's that information?But as far as the reporting DRS. System knowledge, just a summarized.A trial balance of that lower level detail.So."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","We've thought we've, I think we're still, we were still trying to get to a point where we could use that, Vanna, to drill down all the way from our statement line items to that lower level detail. So we can have more, more information and to know specifically who we need to contact, if any additional information is needed."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Her.Yeah. So yeah, like I said, that's been our roadblock, so.If it's something that I find that one of the D5 sites has input at that high at their high level, then I don't have any issues at that point because I have my POC's at the various deepest sites. It's just the field level so.It used to be or we would try to get the information from by contacting the command accountants.And then they would contact their command level PLC's and we've not always.Gotten they've not always gotten responses or timely responses or the POC's at that level aren't sure what information is needed because they're not.Either accountants or much sure.Analyst. But that's been a knowledge gap there.So we've not been able to provide responses.Umm."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","That exactly, Yep."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Umm, I'm not really sure.Based off of various meetings, it seems like they.Umm, they're very positive about it becoming.Uh coming to fruition soon, but I I I I just don't really know."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","UM.Not civilians.So I've.Requested assistance from Jimmy.Which he's a he's a data scientist. Yeah. He put his hand up.Uh so for requested assistance from him and pulling some, you know, feeder level detail for us?And then our contract support.Uh Guidehouse bright doria.As he he'd been, UM, involved with advanta you Lt and ADVANTA and prior years. So he had that background to try to help pull information using queries from advanta. Any information that was in there.Using the sequel.Queries."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Right.It. Yeah, if it's there.And obtain obtainable. Then they've been able to provide something for us."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Yes. And then along with that.Just some sneeze of the various accounting systems and the information is coming out of there. I know what the advantage is supposed to be like standardized.Umm, but then trying to.Put it in a like delete different lines that the our auditors may not need and their populations just so knowing how to do that based off of the data that's coming from those various systems.Selves. Someone like that we would need as well.I."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)",Yes.
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Umm.As far as I know, there is no nothing in place."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)",Umm.
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Umm, well anymore. We're beginning to really use the our SharePoint.Uh to house our data and have it available to the various team members.But uh.I know for the financial reporting team we used to.Keep our that information that we gather here on our shared drive on the D vast network. So like I said, now that we're using the SharePoint more, we're making sure to say that information out there in an organized way and for others to be able to have access to in the event that they need the information for something or.If we're not available, they can get the information for like our our auditors, if they have a question."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)",It's just more accessible.But I haven't noticed any.Change is like what you're describing though.
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. So just basically just the central location for our team to have the information. But like I said, if there's not common instance that hasn't been an instance yet where it's coming handy, like if someone needs to data and they could just go and get it. So we're still requested.The information is still requested of us and we just provide the link to the SharePoint or just.Send the information.Umm, through e-mail or through safe?"
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Also, I'm sorry I forgot this part since there workspaces that happen.Created in the SharePoint where it's like a shared you know the shared spreadsheets and everything where you can see.Real time changes from when working with someone else, so we've been using that capability too. So that's been helpful."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Umm.There's a a good amount of spreadsheets, but then if there is, there's also a lot of PDF's.For like.Supporting documentation for certain accounts that we work.Umm."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)",Right.
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Umm.I guess just to take advantage of the.Umm.The.Tutorials that they provide on there.Uh, especially regarding.Using the ICM query to try to.Obtain information that you need.And then specially in our case when we don't have that drill down capability yet to get down to our details."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Umm, I've only I've not used all of them, but like I said, I've only used.The eye query part.And mostly I just go in there and have played around in there to try to see what information I can find.And you know, I can get a little overwhelming, but.Because it's a lot.So.But for my purpose and what I do, I really need that drill down capability.And that will be key and and in the financial reportings role."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","I believe it's because there's some like like our legacy system data is a problem our sensitive activity.Data is a problem, so the combination of those.Is what? What's held it up?And then."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)",Right.
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Well, when it comes to like my output, which is the financial reporting or sorry financial statements in the footnotes.Umm, those are driven by the that lower level detail and data.Umm. And then of course the statements and footnotes provide the stakeholders the information and need to see how SOCOM is performing with the tax dollars.Hi and then our leadership to be able to determine or make decisions for the the future state of our our organization, so.Umm they they are important. There are other reports that they could look at on the budgetary side like the 1002, but just the combining the financial statements plus those budgets specific budgetary reports is helpful."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","The footnotes are generated.Every quarter, however, the third and fourth quarters are when we add additional verbiage, wording narratives.To supplement the tables that are automatically generated from the reporting system and it just just gives additional information about various line items on the statements.UM.And like if there are any like a the fluctuations saying like what business events?Uh occurred. That caused all those various fluctuations, any abnormal balances?Any just key information, new programs if we have that information that.Uh, you know, costs are need for additional monies and additional budget like funds balance with treasury, things like that.Umm. If we have any legal cases that are going on, we're giving information about those we had to accrue contingent liability liability regarding those.Umm.Al says an an example.Uh, like our status of our supplemental funding, like for COVID-19?Providing information about how that money was.Spent.Umm.So that's that's those are just examples and of course with the COVID-19.We could have used that van, I guess, to get some information that we needed from that, but that hadn't been working well either. So we had to find other means to try to to.Hit the tracking.Information for that."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Well, just having to reach out to other.Uh offices budget.To see how they had been tracking it.Since they weren't using coming to find out, they didn't, they weren't using the specific codes that were to be set up.When that supplemental money was received so they had created.Specific budget line items for those funds. So they provided that information.And I use that then to go to the trial balance.Drill down information that I'm able to get.From the reporting system and kind of isolated it that way and also from the 1002 information.Umm.That.Kevin Spurling, our de fastly Amazon he Mission Support Officer he puts together so using the combination of all that I was able to kind of.Track it from inception fiscal year 20.Umm. And then.Provide an adjusted table.In our footnotes, with the accurate depiction of the status of our funds.Yeah."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Yep, very tedious, very long process."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Umm, well, based off of looking at the the 1002.Information regarding the COVID spending and then comparing it to what was in the trial balance for the codes. The correct codes that should have been used. It was way off.So that's how I knew it was a problem."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Umm.I think that at the field level in the budget they were tracking it in their way.We just didn't know that they used a different means to track it.Uh, until I started asking the question.Umm. And then the table that the the the reporting system created based off of the code they were supposed to be using is new as of this year.So.So I guess it was just, uh, unknown and we were just using the information that the as a data call in the prior years from the component.Umm to show in the Budget Office to show.What money? That there is, Umm, components were received and how much I've been obligated, committed, obligated, and expended those current years."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Umm. Quarterly report time.But, Umm, we had in 20.That first year reporting we'd start, we started getting added to.Saw them bees e-mail distribution.For that consolidated report that they would, where they would get the information from the components and send it up.Umm to OMB?So we just start again added to that, it was like a monthly report. And then as as time went on, that kinda dwindled because they weren't spending the money, had basically already been spending wasn't its active. So I would just have to reach out to him just to make sure I was to get it at least at the quarter.And then we had a data call process in place where we would then still reach out to the component.Umm PLC's to get supporting documentation for the information that they provided in that report and just validate it and then to make sure it could be supported and that was in the form of like details from the accounting system."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Umm.I think that the way we're structured, the the team is structured now.We need more resources for to be able to just keep track of.And detail of like all of these high level.Umm.Uh.Transactions or statement line items.Like another example.Like property real property, I think there needs to be a team at our level that.Become the sneeze of the the property process at the component levels to be able to help them on the accounting side and get the information that we need and just keep constant contact with them and be able to answer questions.UM be able to talk to him about any changes and then they'll be our our go to for on the at the statement level. If we need information. So I think there needs to be just different subsets of groups and and and our division to be able to.Really work closely with the components and T socks on various items because as it stands now, just being one of two in the financial reporting and.The complexities of so, so calm and the various accounting systems and.It it just becomes, it becomes too much and and and unmanageable.To be able to track in that detail.Everything and especially.Almost everything is a problem or problem arises with everything.So I could. I'll just put it that way.Whereas I mean, I would like to be superwoman and and, you know, be involved at that level with everything. But it's just unreasonable."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","I would say.Maybe two to three additional people and then with our contract support.Umm.Yeah.And I'm just basing that off of the different line items that are.That our auditors have been looking at more deeply or asking more questions about.And that, you know, they're they're complex in their own right so."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)",Yes.
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Yes, because.And even if that's, I don't even know if that's possible either. Like I said, with the various systems for that person to become as me, and then those systems and processes and surrounding those line items.Umm but if if so like I said, with the help of the that contract support, it might be better.But yes.So, like, uh, real property or just property, period. What it would come combine in real property with?PP and E general equipment, then OMNS operating materials and supplies funds balance with treasury. That's a major one.Umm.And then accounts receivable accounts payable.Uh being involved with that so?"
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","The major a lot of them, a lot of the findings and NFR's, we're more so oversight roles.Umm, when we're.Yeah, doing our.Caps for those in a Fars.Correct. The action plans were like oversight, so.Umm.But I've always said that in order for us to be good, have provide good oversight, we need to know we need to be able to, to know what's going on, to know that if we look at something, we can recognize. If it doesn't seem white or if it's wrong or.If they need our help with obtaining information to be able to do that.Otherwise, having oversight just doesn't mean anything. We're just gonna look and check the box."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","UM more so, like for instance for reconciliations that deep fast performs on our behalf.Yeah, their outputs were those that them sending it to us and we just, you know review.Test to make sure that it's done. It was done.Umm. But again, if they have any variances, they don't. You don't. They don't come to our office to get those resolved there. Going back to the submitters of the information or other defects offices to figure out what the problem is. So there's never need been need a need to come to solve from AOL or soft from Fr to help them resolve those."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","And then another another example journal vouchers.That are being done at the various DFAST sites they're sending to softball Fr for review.And in those.Are oversight. Is just to make sure we understand all the ticketing time, what they're doing, and that the posting logic that they're using makes sense."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","The US GL General Ledger accounts that they're using.Umm, like if they're adding funding?That they're using the appropriate accounts based thought of the fact that if it's current year versus prior year.There's different accounts that they would use.Uh. Or if they're journal vouchers, saying they're doing one thing and but the posting logic is showing something different.We would pick up on that and inquire about it."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Right, right. So yeah, we have, sorry we have like the Treasury Financial manual that has various posting logic for the accounts to be used based off of the various business events that occur."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","I think I'm going back to what I previously previously mentioned. If they're a little subsets of individuals on our team that becomes sneeze where over the different line items where if once we're putting to the financial statements and putting those together along with defects and we need that additional information to be able to reach out to those POC's and either they provide us the information we need.Or they're able to go out.Umm to their POC's, who have been reliable or been a source of reliable information and timely information for them.And then then coming back to us with with the information kind of like.How?Agency Y de Fast Agency wide has their POC's for every agency that they reach out to. They need additional information. If our agency is causing a material balance on the DoD Y financial statements right, they would reach out to their POC's. We're supposed to just give them information they're not having to worry about chasing after our field level people to try to figure out the answer.So just having better quality and reliable sources.That we can reach out to because we have such strict deadlines, we just don't have the time.To try to figure out either figure out on our own.Which normally would probably take a long it would. It would take longer than we had, but.Again, just having someone that we could rely on that knows.So calm and our data.And it's a sneeze. And they been able to focus on just that one thing to be able to. You really give us detailed information."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Umm.Just that it's accurate.Umm.Rarely reliable. Accurate.Uh.We're getting it on time because of our straight deadlines.And it's organized in a way that is easily understood. I, you know, we we know what's what it is and and not having to really question it.So those are pretty much the most important time accuracy complete. It's all there.And it could be validated."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)",Yes.Umm.Yes.Unfortunately.
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Umm.Organized in that, like if there's you were asking for some, you know, something specific, it's not readily like shown in the information that's provided like you you could make maybe you can highlight or.You know, provide like a page number of the document where we need to look things like that."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)",Right. So we're spinning our wheels trying to see how they come up with something.So we just have to reach out and get that information and sometimes it's they remember one time that was an instance where they did some type of calculation but they didn't provide their workbook of their calculation so.Things like that.
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)",Right.
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Umm.I don't know that they exist at though their level.I know.For some, for some. For some things they they have to.You are.Had their own controls like component. When I say that components PLC's T, socks PLC's.Controls in place to be able to validate the data that they're providing to us and certify that it is accurate and in those cases then we're not having to do a lot of that validation on our own once it gets up to us.Umm.But as far as in what we do receive that we need to validate it currently.There are no detailed desktop procedures in place as of yet as far as what to look at for those in that documentation as perceived."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Umm, there's no specific reason, it's just with when the processes were being set up over the years.Those big items like general equipment, that's the big one. It's just that that's what they was with the project team that was in place. That was what they came up with.Umm, because it was just. It was so much and it's so time consuming. It's we needed and we're not staffed and and saw from AOL to be able to validate all of this information. So we need the components of that size to have some accountability there and to be able to certify that what they're providing us.Is, is, is correct and accurate? Some of the newer processes that we've have been sent in place like.Uh, all madness.We have an established that yet, but it'll it'll probably be the same thing with that as well.And then our lease.Leases.Our data calls for leases we hadn't established that it's been, it had been kind of manageable because that's just a a annual data call.Umm, but we still need then at that year and when we do a new data call, we need people to be able to validate it. But I think in the upcoming CAP that we're going to put in place for data calls for no food, no data calls to see about having a certification being put in place with those PLC's as well. And that will relieve.Our team, from having to take time to do that.Umm.Again, base due to our strict deadlines.Right."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)",Right. That that's the plan.
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Yes.So unless.If we get those teams set up, then there there can be the they can perform those reviews."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)",And validations.
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)",The components and T socks.
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Uh.I believe so.I guess it it it will be up to their leadership coming to an agreement.Umm, and then usually in the prior cases of soft foam created those certification letters that the components of Jesus had to sign agree to sign. So.Uh-huh."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)",Now OK.
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Umm.I think that at the HQ level there could be some.Like annual.Umm data calls that are sent out.Or not annual? I am just saying just every year, just a norm of submissions that are expected to be due by composing T socks that would be needed.Umm for financial reporting purposes and if they establish those.Deadlines and submissions kind of like how OSD had, you know, establishes.Deadlines that all of the components are supposed to adhere to and provide deliverables that they need to provide.If they if HQ set up something like that.Umm. And that way all these data calls are not having to be sent out individual, they just know that every year they have to submit.To headquarters, those deliverables and you know, track them, them tracking it at that level and ensuring it's there whenever we need it. I think that would be helpful as well not, I don't know if that's something that could be done or not, but just to that's just as they they know that there's some accountability there.And UM, not everything being put on soft from AOL and having to speak to other offices data, and they could just be out there and they can receive questions on it if need be."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","And then we and then we would have POC's too, right? They submitted that information. We will have a name and a a contact information that we can go to if need be as well.And then.Umm."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)",Yep.Ask.
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","Yes, if there if we're sending it from our office specifically and just it's it's various POC's, right. So having to follow up with them and making sure that they're gonna you know get it to us if they missed the deadline.UM, following up with them. So it's just it it it's it's taxing. So I figure I feel that having it come from headquarters and it's just a requirement, quarterly requirements and deadlines for these deliverables.That would be helpful."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)","No questions, just I hope that you guys can help us get better with with everything so.Appreciate it."
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)",And get you too.
"Moore, Demita N CIV SOCOM HQ SOCOM (USA)",Bye bye.
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, ma'am."
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No. So I I retired in March from the military. I was, I've been in special OPS since 05.I got into cell phone in 2016. I worked in cellphone mess. I worked all the sensitive activities and classified programs.I did that until I retired and then I got hired as the director of Sophie B, which is the budget, you know, budget execution in terms of operational maintenance dollars.And what else did you want? I'm sorry.OK."
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. So we have a multiple appropriations, which is what, Congress, you know, appropriates funding. So we have milcon funding, which is military construction. We have RDT and E which is research and development. We have procurement dollars, those three pots of money or basically multi year money. And then we have operational maintenance funding, which is basically A1 year appropriation, which basically gets after all your day-to-day requirements.And you know any type of operational needs in terms of going, you know, travel or supplies or maintenance or you know stuff like that. So that's kind of what we have a non point $6 billion.Operational budget. And that's my what I'm in charge of. That's my scope."
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","We're both. We're responsible for both and soften. Be so. We have our execution sign. We have a formulation side which a formulation is dealing with the what we call a budget estimate submission and kind of helping with the program Objective Memorandum which is the palm which is goes, you know five years out. So we as soften, we're responsible for current year and budget year. So right now we're working 23 and 24 also starting to work 25 and then in the palm they work 25 and through.I don't know UH-30, I would say, uh, so you know that's kind of where we're at. We're in a, you know, not the.Umm, we do get involved in that process, but we're not. We're more focused on the immediate requirements in the next couple of years."
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","But but we do do execution in terms of like we monitored execution, uh, we don't actually execute dollars, but we do. We're very involved in the day-to-day monitoring, making sure there's any shortfalls need to be funded, their analysis, stuff like that."
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. Then, to be honest with you, that's my biggest frustration right now. You know, working in sofa mess.I found that it was a little bit easier cause we had specialized programs.And we were able to access the data through this for the most part what I needed. But over here since I hit the ground in mid-september, I have literally not been able to pull any data on my own without reaching out to the components and asking them to put manual data on a SharePoint in order for me to know. I mean just simple stuff like the other day I was wanted to run a a quick report for what we call or if which is the money we get a special authority.To buy Momentos pay for dinners you know, and dignitaries come in. And I just wanted to run a report which I would have done 1000 times in my career with no issues and I couldn't do that. I had to literally wait to an analyst came in and basically make sure that the portal was updated with the data from the components because we can't rely on data from the fist. So anyway."
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, it's just because every service has its own ERP system and we used to have fists which kind of brought all that together. But now that we've made the shift to go to advana, I don't think there was any bridging strategy to get us to that point. And now we're just kind of in limbo and then, you know, the Navy went to a new ERP system, which is not as I guess user friendly and there wasn't any any.Yeah, I don't know how you say it, but there wasn't things put in place into fist that could pull the data from them. So we have that Dai system. We have teams on the Air Force and then we have GFEBS and GFEBS say, which is the sense of activities. All those systems, you know in theory should feed into fists and then we could pull reports and we don't have to query the units every day for different types of things. But that doesn't work. I mean, I'm at year end trying to close out the fiscal year. You know we were, you know, I noticed an extreme example, but you know, we're at.Come trying to tell a we're trying to brief device Commander every day on where you're end is because the Hurricanes hitting and I literally have to wait until I get in touch with Fort Bragg or get in touch with ABS sock or get in touch with sock pack or soccer or whatever in order for me to be able to give him accurate data, you know, and it's I just never have function like this in my life. It's just, yeah, I've always been able to pull data when I needed it. It may have been 24 hours.Old, but at least it was 24 hours old. Now. I can't do that."
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Correct. So you know, being a joint headquarters, you know it's different if you're like a four-star Army headquarters, cause everybody's using gfebs, everybody's using G sibs essay. So it's it's a very easy system. But what I was being so Colombian, a joint headquarters, every service is using a different ERP system and without that fish or whatever that you know that database or whatever it is that needs to pull those data from all those different systems without having that in place and without having.A plan in place to bridge that from FIST to Ivana, where I mean, like I said, it's extremely frustrating for me because I literally cannot do my job without reaching out to the components right now."
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I don't. I I I don't wanna go into like cause I got here in September. So I I don't know the history of what happened. I I I do know being in the military for 26 years that every time we roll out a new system they say it's gonna be on board you know a certain time and it comes on board 10 years later so I you know I don't know you know like gfebs and gfebs say I mean gfebs A which is what we because you know our classified programs they operate in more of a.Uh. A stove pipe. So you know, so the data is not readily available to just, you know, cause gfebs being an ERP system, it's more susceptible to people, you know, seeing what's going on well with gfebs a I mean, I was at usasoc as a young captain. They were talking about that. And we just realized that I think in the last two years. So, you know, it's been 10-15 years before we came on board. I don't know what happened with Ivana. I just know that there was a big shift that, hey, we're going to Ivana, just like we did with the ERP systems. And when we did the ERP systems, it was the same thing.Hey, we all go into ERP and because we wanna get auditable, but we really didn't think about, you know, coming up with any bridging strategy to get there. We just had to endure the pain. Like right now, warcom, the Navy seals, they're going to Dai this year. Well, they can't even give me, you know, we just had a a meeting this week with them. They don't even know what their obligations are, which is, you know, the money they spent. They are literally keeping everything on a spreadsheet because they went to this new system. And they can't, they still going through all the.Pain of trying to figure out how to utilize the new system, you know and MARSOC did that last year. So now Mark Sock is good to go. They're happy, everything's going well, but now Morcom is going to that, you know, going through that pain. It's just, I don't know, I'm sure in the private sector is the same stuff, but here we just we make a decision and we don't really like.Come up with a bridge in solution and that's what the deal is with Ivana. At least what I've seen now trivia Cole will you know who's the lead for that will be able to give you all the history of what happened and why it happened. But I so I don't know what happened there."
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Last time I heard was December time frame but like I told you, I just knowing my my history and my experience that I I doubt that will be fully functional at that point. But.Who knows? I don't know. But at the same time, like I said, it's just.Umm, there's a lot of things that happen, you know, like we've programmed up here and we track things by EOC, which is element of cost.But the units executed by different things than. Then we have the crosswalk that all you know and that's what the Oracle BI or the bias or whatever we call it kind of did for us, you know and you know, so there's a lot of complications as to when if the data is ever gonna be accurate, hopefully in the next few years, it'll be to the point where we can just pull the data and do what we got to do and.But there's there is a lot of complications in order to make that happen. So it's it's it's just that unique thing that you know, we're pulling 9 four different systems or three different systems, I guess now and then you know, they're executing one way. We need the data in a certain way in order to roll it up to you know it it's it's complicated."
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yep.
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","We have it. We just don't know if it's accurate and that's that's like we have we I can go in fish right now and pull over, pull it. However, some some of the data may be 2 weeks old, some of the data may be yesterday, some of the data may not be pulled in correctly. You know we just like perfect example like today, yesterday. You know my one of my analysis is trying to do a congressional report. Well the consistent theme that I get from them when they have to do these is that they cannot rely on fish.Because fissus that is wrong. So I I and I don't know what broke. I don't know if it's when Dai came on board. You know, with that new ERP system or but at some point something broke because I used to be able to when I was an analyst and self a mess, I could pull all my data and it was data from different components you know? So it wasn't, you know I was pulling data from different ERP systems through fist so Oracle so I didn't have that issue and it was real time that it might be like I said 24 hours old but it was real time data so.I don't know when at all just went to hell, you know, and broke."
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I think it's twofold. I think it's both because like like the auth report that I was talking about earlier, you know.We push our guidance on how to execute things and where they should execute it, where to certain program element or whatever. Well, some of the components followed that guy and some of them don't. Well, it should be on us to say, hey, I'm not seeing your obligations out there. What's going on? Why are you executing the wrong place? You know, it's just like when I was at usasoc and I built the access database and I used to do all this cuz we didn't have BI at that point and I did all this myself. And then every day I'd run a report and I'd see what fallout, you know, what fell out.In terms of the crosswalk that I built at that time, you know, if things fell out then I knew one or two things, either one we had like a new.I knew what we called it back then is.A new year will see a new data point where it just it was something that was new for that fiscal year. We haven't used it in the past, so I gotta I gotta go fix my, you know, my crosswalk or two, the units executed in the wrong place. So then that was my opportunity to go in there and say, hey, you screwed this up, you need to fix this. You know, you need to do a cost transfer and say, hey, you know, this is the correct P put it in this PR, whatever. So I think that's twofold. So I think there's people that are executing it in the wrong place. But I think it's also some.There's issues with the.You know connection as to the crosswalk and just things are just not coming over like they should."
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Absolutely. You know that's that's the the big thing. Cause if we could run those reports and we were able to see what fell out, you know, maybe you know, some type of crosswalk could say, hey, something's not right, you know, this is these lines are not aligning with a certain EOC a certain program then you know we would be able to hold people accountable but right now we have no.Trust or we have no.Confidence in the data that's coming out of fist that we can't even, you know, send it to the components to say, hey, why is this off? We just like we've lost all confidence."
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I'm sorry somebody came off, I said. Can you repeat that question? I'm sorry."
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I don't.Yeah, I honestly, I I don't know if I wanna go on record, but I I don't think that's an issue, you know like.This feast or famine in this place, you know, in every government job and to be honest with you, I worked in a private sector for eight months prior to coming here and I saw it there too. You know, there's, I don't think anybody here is is overworked, you know. And so I honestly don't think that's the issue. I think it's just.You know.Uh, first training people to do the right thing cause you know, like the thing I just talked about with using access when I was, you know, a young captain in 2005, 2000, you know, to 2010 and doing those things most people can't do that. You know, most people don't even know what across work is. They don't know what a table is. They don't know what a query is. They don't know how to build those relationships. They don't know how to build a report out of a database. So they just didn't they don't know those things. So it's probably a lot of training there using power BI nowadays. I'm not an expert on Power BI but maybe that's the way but the future whatever.You know, but I think there's training or I I I don't.I think that you know, there's going to be a time like right now. I may lose 5 military in the next two years. Then to me, that's when I'm gonna say, hey, I can't do things because that is going to cut me so deep that I just can't do things. But I right now, I think I'm sufficiently staffed to do what I need to do."
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I think they're they should be requirements, but you know, federal government positions or, you know, there's so many other requirements that sometimes you don't. You can't just be so selective on who you know who you like bringing in young talent is hard for us because in, unless we bring it in through some type of developmental program, you know, how many young people coming out of college can, you know, have a certain level of certification, have the level experience, you know, a GS13 requires so many years of experience.How many years? So many certifications and all that? Well, you don't achieve that unless you were prior military. Or maybe you've been in federal government along time. You know, that's where we faced those difficulties of, you know, we don't we can't recruit that young talent that may have that skill set that we need.Umm.But at the same time, you know I what I've been pushing since I got here is, you know, like yesterday and the day before we had somebody come in and did advance Excel skills, you know, so those are the things that people may know how to do, a pivot table, but they don't know how to do vlookup and do all the other advanced items that maybe, you know, can enhance their job. And the same thing with power BI or access or whatever. They don't have that skill set. But hopefully in the future, we can get them the skills that you know, because it would be.A nice to have if we can get them to have those types of skills because we're we're still limited by the way we hire people that we're not gonna be able to bring that young 20 to you, a 24 year old out of college that just got all of this experience and classes on power BI and you know or in.Say ASAP and all this stuff that they just, you know, and get ready to go into the privacy. We can't recruit those people because our requirements are so high to get into a GS13 position, you know. So I think that is a.And a roadblock that we have to overcome, but."
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. So we we had our CFO, DFO, Deputy Chief Financial Officer. She brought in somebody that she had worked with when she was an Air Force and had them come in for two days and it was good. You know, everybody that went there, if anything, it was a refresher and it was good for them people for those people, you know. And they learned like different functions that are very helpful in order to, you know.Get their skill set up a little bit. So yes, we coordinated that ourselves and the same thing with the power BI and stuff like that. I think that, you know, going forward that stuff that we gotta figure out how to incorporate because you know, as a government, as a financial analyst, we're required depending on what level of certification you are, you're required to do add hours of CPS or 40 hours of CPU every two years. So you know, that's part of our plan anyway or 60 hours depending on. So, you know, we gotta start utilizing instead of taking classes that just.Or not, you know, not beneficial. We need to start incorporating that into our.Our plans as well."
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Absolutely. I think that it's, you know, especially like I said, I know that the big push on the private sector right now is power BI. I worked for Mosaic before I came here and everything was about Power BI. Everything was about pulling data from different locations and making the dashboard and you know, stuff like that. I think you know because we already using SAP system, you know we using the ERP system. So we're pretty equivalent when we come to the private sector on that.And you know, we already bringing in BI, you know we were using Oracle BI but now you know the shift is the other way you know. So I think that's.I think it'd be great if maybe Jason would offer something maybe every quarter or something, you know, just for people to roll in there and you know.Be able to get those refresher trainings."
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Absolutely. You know, we have pretty good participation in the last two days.Obviously you know it's very dependent on the time of the year. You know, if you tell us that we gotta go to class in September, it's probably not gonna happen. August is probably not gonna happen because we're building a budget in August. We're closing out the fiscal year in September. So there's some peak times that we just couldn't do it. But for the most part, you know, there's other times of the year that I would highly encourage my people to go to those trainings because I just think it's.You know, it's it's I I tell people this all the time. Like when I build those access databases. When I was young captain, they had analyst that was spent three to four days putting together a pivot table in order to figure out how to do that data. And then you had to now analyze it to figure out what fell out and all that. I was able to do that in access in 10 minutes. You know, once I got it built. But, you know, it's just things like that. But people don't know."
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, I think it would be good because like I said, you know, like I may, I may get a retired enlisted soldier E7 or whatever that meets all the qualifications and we hire them, you know, but may not have just that one-on-one like most of the people I've worked with throughout my career don't even know how to spell access, you know, or don't understand what a database is or how data works and how to manipulate data. You know, they literally have been hand jamming an Excel spreadsheet their whole life, you know. So I just think it would be.I think it would be better."
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Absolutely. You know, as soon as I have not been in been given a demonstration on Ivana, I don't know what capabilities Ivana brings, to be honest with you.But.I absolutely to me, every place I've ever been and been stationed. I've done a dashboard, you know, and it just makes everything easier. Like, right now, if you go to the cell phone.A portal on a Siprnet, which is where we hold all our data like all our all our great ideas died about three years ago. So everything out there is like three or four years old. We have nothing of the data out there. We have totally abandoned all those data initiatives.That we have started, you know, we had a dashboard out there at one point. We had, you know, a bunch of stuff and everything has died, you know. So yes, it would be my goal to get that up and running that way. As a leader, you know, it's OK for me to, you know, when I was, you know, a man analyst, you know, as a Lieutenant Colonel or whatever it was OK for me to go out there and spend time.Ohh as a major you know manipulating data or hours in that, but as a GS15 or 06 or whatever you know I I don't have that time so it's great to have those dashboards and great and even for the front office you know the SES is.You know something that they could pull up if they can't get in touch with me or whatever, you know, they have something that they could be able to answer, an RFI right now we don't have that. It's literally frustrating because you know, I have to wait through. Somebody comes in or I have to wait until sock packs, you know, until 2:00 o'clock when socpac comes in and it's 8:00 o'clock out in Hawaii, 8:00 AM in the morning or I have to wait till soccer.You know, you know to. I got to hurry up and get here early so I can call asaki or before they go home, you know, it's just stuff like that. It's just like.That's horrible. You know, as a four-star headquarters with a $10 billion budget in terms of just operational maintenance, not including RDN Proq, you know we're still at that level."
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Honestly, I don't know why. Uh, I I assume maybe just data.Still, the validity or you know having good data maybe at some point they just lost confidence in it. I worked in sofa mess like I said and you know, in sofa mess, you pretty much like and your little bubble cause you're working all classified. So I wasn't install from B and most of that stuff out there is sofam. B is sofam I which is investments.We're driven by them and then it just died. And I honestly I haven't got the history on that and and that may be to some, you know, maybe some manpower cuts or maybe they just chose to taste risk in that area.And but I don't know. I'd have to ask, you know, some of the people that's been here a while."
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Absolutely. You know the CFO and CFO vague on especially DFO like she's the one literally put that training together for Excel, you know? So she's she's all about the, you know, advancing people's skills and using the newest technologies. So absolutely. No, no.And I think that even our vice commander who?This is the first vice I've had in years. That or since I've been in SOCOM. That is so interested in budget and like he, I guarantee you he would love to have a dashboard where he could go out there and check every day, whereas our execution, you know, where is our you know? So I think he would absolutely embrace it. So yes, absolutely."
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I think that's the biggest hurdle, to be honest. Like if if we like I be honest every day that I get tasked with an R file which is like 10 times a day.Is the first quote first thing out of people's mouth is. I can't trust the data that's out there, so I have to contact these people. And so I think that's my biggest roadblock and I hate it because I've never had to do that in my career. I've always been able to pull the data for the most part, unless it's something specific that just you just can't pull. Like simpay like with sip pay civilian pay dollars, you know, we we have two things, you know, we have execution and we have work years.Well, in order to work years, you have to have access to those ERP systems right now. You know, I don't know if in the future Ivana may have something that we could pull in, but right now, you know, I would have to literally have access to every ERP system and then be able to pull that data myself. But for the most part, everything else is not like that. So.I I think so."
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I I don't. I don't have the history, to be honest with you. I I just know that.In the last couple years, from what I've been told, the data is not accurate and it, you know, like right now we're trying to.Build a what they call lost by empire, which means that hey.You know.Assoc executed. You know $3 billion and then after year end they deoxygenated, which means they basically you know it's like you writing down something and your checkbook and you say hey, this check's gonna cache and then the check never caches and then all of a sudden you have, you know, $100 more after the new year. The same thing with obligations. The only difference is is that since it's a one year appropriation.You basically lose that buying power, so it's like you having $100 extra, you checking account and then you know September 30, if is over October 1st is here and then the bank takes it, you know and that's kind of how we work when you're appropriations. So you know eventually the money goes back to the Treasury at some point. Well. So we're building that data right now over a 10 year period, but.Like we're we're we heard a hamstrung on you know what the validity of whether or not it's accurate, because we still have to reach back to the components to say, hey, is this data wrong? Is this that right? You know when that happened. And I honestly don't know.And I."
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I think I I kind of you know, just having real time data in my hands. I don't know how that happens.Uh, it would. It would be a blessing to me because like I said, I'm.The last eight weeks or that I've been on the job. My biggest frustration is not being able to get that on, not being able to get what I need.And relying on other people that pull that data."
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Now as far as the purpose of this is, this is just to gather all the facts as to maybe hopefully build the way ahead is that the purpose of this or?"
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","OK. No, I appreciate it. I I hope I didn't invent too much. It's I guess said, I love that it's always been a passion of mine and I, I I like to have real town dad at my hands and and being able to streamline stuff and hopefully we can get there going forward."
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Awesome. Thank you, Jessica. Thank you. Jerry. Victor."
"Shill, Daniel J CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Have a great day.
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, it's. I have two primary customers that I work with. Investments is all executed by the soft ACNL organization.So they're they're the executors and builders of our budgets for procurement and party, TNA.The military construction program is joint managed between ourselves and socks E and the engineer's office. Those dollars are executed by the service construction agents on behalf of the components and two socks."
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Absolutely. That's pretty much what we do.
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","All of the above.Face to face meetings, emails.SharePoint databases. There's a number of different OSD owned databases that we operate in submission tools that are managed by OSD, for budget documents or execution is managed through the service accounting systems. AT&L has their own internal accounting.I wouldn't call it an accounting system, but it a management tracker for financial data. So we use all of the data.No, no repositories if you will to kind of pull together the.No. So insurance? Well, what I would do, I will work it out."
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, no, but I don't. I don't know the technicalities of it. The next person you talked to firm Gruda who actually drives all of that data. You'll be better inform you on where, where it does and doesn't."
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Umm, you know, obviously I'd like.More reliable, consistent, available data in which to produce recommendations and.Uh, products, so that would be that's always the ultimate goal, no matter where you're at, I suspect."
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, but there's only so much that we can actually control. We don't actually own the data, and we use the data and.Ohh, aggregated so you know we have we constantly chase.Data inequities and figure or.Reconcile reconciliation and don't mention."
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","So I mean we we track execution.That's one of our primary functions. So our execution data comes from service owned Systems, Department owned systems and we have to then make sure that data isn't in alignment with what the AT&L folks thinks should be there. Oftentimes that's somewhat different at whatever level sometimes at the macro level, it's pretty good at the detail level. It's oftentimes somewhat inconsistent. So you know it's a matter of.Getting that data easily accessible and reliable. It's really kind of what we need.But I don't know how much control we have, how much control we actually have over there."
c73bbd99-7250-47be-8887-1def6c67592b,"And I'm sorry that when you.I'm sorry. Just I just a quick question to clarify, I'm not 100% sure that when you say execution date, you're talking about like technical operational data, right?"
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I'm talking about like obligations, commitments, how, how the funding is actually executing."
c73bbd99-7250-47be-8887-1def6c67592b,Gotcha. OK.
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Contracts, contracts. What obligation post?Etcetera."
c73bbd99-7250-47be-8887-1def6c67592b,Perfect. Thank you.
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yep.
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, absolutely. For the most part."
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, we we chased chickens through the forest."
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I don't think we exist without data.Data is what we need.Everything that we do revolves around.Information.That is reported.Responded to that kind of thing. And then.We don't exist without that, that that is what we do."
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Would be surprised this here and nobody said anything to the contrary.
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yep.
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",No immigrant.
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Umm, I wouldn't say it's a lot different than what we're actually doing, at least in my particular area. I mean, it's not much different. You know we we build a budget, we submit that budget to the hill, the Hill reviews, that budget and looks at it based on past execution performance.Ohh, our scheduling performance is our our main things.If the previous years of execution don't support what we're asking for, we wind up getting reduced, which has a, you know, an impact on the time in which we feel.Ohh capabilities to the work order.So from from the build to the execution to the reporting to the decisions that are made as to whether we should or shouldn't have money, it's critical and dependent on us being able to not only perform the obligations and the delivery capability, but also be able to manage and track it so that when we're requesting it in the future or when we're looking at whether we should request it, we're basing that on the current.Done previous performance.No."
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, it's an error."
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Evolved.Like positions that are unfilled.
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, we don't have that problem.Or fully staffed."
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I certainly hope so. Yeah. Or they're just afraid to kiss me off and leave.No, I was being serious. I I think it's that we have a really good a good function. We do a good job and.It's it's mature and it runs put together the most fun."
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Sure.That's like words time off awards, those type of things.Annual appraisal bonuses, etcetera."
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, we're all required to maintain a certification. So they have to, they have to achieve 80 hours of continuing education every two years, so.And we report them now, but not only the opportunity, but we mandate that they do it."
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","But not in my director. And I have two integrators that deal. I'm merely with data that would be called data scientists or thinking about, but they manage our databases, they do the reporting tools. So such stuff you're gonna talk to one of them. So I'm pretty good at little later today."
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I believe that mean man think you'll get a better data point component as to whether he's overworked or when I know he's not under utilized. Question is whether whether the question is whether he feels that we need more.He's never voiced that opinion, but."
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, our our senator izations already pre defined by the data structures that are built into the accounting and finance systems.So we don't really have latitude in that. The only the only thing we would have latitude is that the products in which we display that information and we are.You know, there's certain things that we have to do in order to meet guidance from OSD for a budget submission. We don't have any latitude in that, you know, internal ones would be how we review execution data. But and it's basically done through my PowerPoint slide deck.That holds the data in and.Spotlights the.The financial information and then ATL provides the.You know the the words that go along with whether they're behind the head."
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Spends on how we're doing it. Four and two. So monthly we do an internal execution review.In preparation for a monthly I PR with the AE where he reviews all the acquisition programs. Also we use that same data for a monthly vice commander budget execution review. That's across all appropriation.And then quarterly, we report our execution data to the Congress.The provided also to USB control."
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Uh, the internal and the I PR and the vice commander are all done via PowerPoint, the OSD and the congressional reporting done via a spreadsheet data set that's extracted from the accounting systems."
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Not specifically. I mean we're aware of it and we know that OST controller uses have been and we.Bounce that data against what we see, which is the first we haven't ourselves yet gotten into advanta.Umm but yeah, we will. I'm certain that's the wedding. Did is going so. But we have not specifically had a name.Interaction in system itself. I know we have people that are tracking it and ready to do so. When that time comes."
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I don't know enough about it, I just expect it's another reporting city."
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I wanted to sort of firm on that because I'm not. I'm not at the technical level, so I don't actually see how the data is moving and how it organizes and compiles and reports."
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I remember I've been in 26 years.No, nothing related to this.OK. Yeah, sure. I think the headquarters needs to realize that the reason we are at headquarters is because of our Title 10 resourcing function.Over the years, we have grown into a quasi.Headquarters for a bunch of different operational functions that should, in my opinion, not reside at the headquarters and it takes manpower away from what our primary function as a title ten headquarters was to manage resources."
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yeah.It's aggregated.
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Well, I don't know. I understand any commander has prioritized Title 10 functions, but I've yet to see a result of that. But he's only just got here, so we'll see.Every commander has a new view and the problem is that view just doesn't carry over all sometimes."
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Umm.No.That's a that's affected by, I don't know."
c73bbd99-7250-47be-8887-1def6c67592b,"God, I was just curious for your.It seems like you have you work a lot with external entities.What?If you could kind of walk us through.Like the key deliverables from your section.Uh. And then what are the inputs you're using and what's the output? I know you mentioned a few of them, but if you could just focus on that, we have that in the transcript."
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","OK, so we are a budget submitting office for the investment appropriations. So we produce a budget document that goes to OSD and then to Congress.That budget document is built based on the inputs we received from the acquisition and the engineering community.That data is built upon.Ohm, the current and past execution and must support the request for future funding.And that all of that data resides in systems that we actually don't own.Umm, but we have ones that.Aggregated in order to produce these documents, the the information that is transmitted as governed by the OSD Comptroller and it's their systems that we put this data into in order to transmit.And.Our own monitoring of how execution is performed. The same data in these systems as aggregated into our own.Views, if you will, of how we portray it and monitor and track it.The the technical bits and bytes and how those zeros and ones work is I don't I don't know, it's below mine.Technical capability."
c73bbd99-7250-47be-8887-1def6c67592b,"Sure. No, that makes sense.OK.Yeah, that's that's really all I have.Appreciate."
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Absolutely.
"Woods, Sean G CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",You'll have a good day. You too. Bye.
"Roberts, William C CTR USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",No. Get on this side.
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",We're good here.
"Roberts, William C CTR USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, I'll go first. Uh. Cult Roberts over here. I saw from SI work in the military intelligence program. Uh, only with soften or or SOCOM for about 2 1/2, maybe three months now. So still kind of learning all the entrances that Jerry's going to provide for us, especially with the joint communities on how all these different systems kind of marry into each other and how to get a valid and accurate product out of all that those systems combined."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Good afternoon. My name is Monica. I'm a retired army finance officer. I spent most of my time at Fort Bragg in the 82nd doing financial management and then hopped into special operations over at JSOC since 2005. So I've been at the execution level executing the budget.Umm, transitioned palm data into a budget estimate, and then into year of execution data at the JSON level and then moved up here when I retired to SOCOM in the Accounting office and I worked three years as the Army Command accountant, so I'm familiar with all six to nine different accounting systems across the services. I understand how they combine and DCD, DCL are now advana how they report up and through the 1002 and now I'm back working in software, Ms working at a budget.Analysts level within a special program. 3 special programs that are nested within HTML and then within our components. So I have a myriad of experience with data dot aggregation and taking data and turning it into.Cognizant information that can be used in a timely manner for decision makers to make decisions with."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, please do. I'm open to it, because right now I'm experiencing lots of problems with the way the data is aggregated and reported up and out up into the Department of Defense so."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",I just messaged him. Let me call him. Hold on.
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",They're brought just log in.
581e6fdb-2eee-4d3a-9150-d1a27b4a45cd,"Hey, this is Brett. Yeah. Sorry, I was having some teams issues."
"Roberts, William C CTR USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, I can go first on that one. So again, I'm doing the military intelligence program execution. So really just looking at current year data and how each of the different services that utilize SOCOM funding, how they execute it, how they received the funding and take all that information and report that up to USD intelligence and security throughout the year, just to kind of make sure that we're good stewards of the funding that SOCOM receives. And I think one of my biggest frustrations that I'm seeing.I think the current systems that we have such as PBIS and fists, it does an adequate job of tracking execution, but not necessarily anything outside of execution. So the obligations in the expenditures, what I really struggle with is finding out where the actual authority relies. So if I give money to NSA or if I give money to JSOC.Uh, when it goes into those systems and flow databases outside of Headquarters, SOCOM, we kind of lose the visibility of where that funding resides and it makes it very difficult for me to be able to track if I have X number dollars in My Portfolio and how much of it have I executed and how much of it have actually been dispersed out to the vendors. So that's the data that I'm really struggling to to gain as again the total authority, where do we send that money and how does that relate to?The the the the customer would there be like app, Soccer, JSOC or whoever had they execute? I can't. I kind of lose that visibility on where they are spending that money out of."
"Roberts, William C CTR USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I would say all the above. So the systems that headquarters SOCOM uses the fish and the and pbis, at least for the purpose that I'm using for, wasn't really tailored to track the total authority, just more of the obligations and the expenditure side of it. So for my preview, I think that's where really kind of we have a gap of information. I do have to rely on the actual source, whether it be going to Dems for the Air Force or G.For the army.And there's just more of kind of relying on other.Entities like Mr. Young, who's able to pull those data directly from that that source and provide that data to me, I just don't have a way at my level to be able to have that kind of a one stop shop where I can get reliable, accurate information.In time to report it to the appropriate authorities."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Sure. So I manage in my programs non MIP SAT funds. So I have to pull data out of a myriad of systems in order to create. Basically for deliverables I have to report an annual report and this annual report includes the year that just ended, the current execution for four to five different appropriations. I have to provide the correct data.In the annual report for the President's budget, and then I have to provide the palm data for the five out years by appropriation, and then even further at different classification levels by capability areas.That is all needed for one annual report, usually.One of the reports is almost 50 pages. The other one is I don't know 5 to 8 and then the last one is maybe 4 to 6 pages, but it has a lot of financial data that has to be brought together to report and then has to actually have a narrative with it and it's to justify. It's the president's budget exhibits for saps and it's to justify our request to funding funds from the President to Congress from that annual report, we pull data.Out of there. But we also provide current data for congressional staff briefings, which usually happened 30 to 40 days after the president submits his budget to Congress. And again, it's pulling all that different those different data points and making it.Umm you usable data points to provide in a staff briefing, then semiannually we do the mid year execution reviews we normally have to do that twice. We do it to the end of March as the traditional semi annual and then they'll have us do it again at the end of April for more accurate information as they're looking across the enterprise to potentially pay bills who's under executing and then we have.Different times throughout the years where we get congressional RFI, I guess that's the 5th deliverable where we have to actually provide accurate information or yeah answers to questions from Congress members or professional staff members.Not always financially, but the good 40% of the questions revolve around finances and we have to be able to provide all of that data in a timely fashion."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Umm. So we'll do since we're at end of year right now. Uh, so we have to feed actual data into an OSD Comptroller database and GRMS. I don't know what it stands for. It used to be called PRCP.The data that is input there is fed from the op 32 and the op one ex budget exhibits which come out of the Peebs Miss and the Peebs Miss data.Is.You know, as a financial manager, you want to look at any of your reports being some type of financial statement certified by a CFO or Budget Officer out of a system of record. But that doesn't happen. It's data that's pulled out of all these different accounting systems to include the fists, which is a warehouse in order to fill in this op, 31 and this OPP, one that gets loaded up into the pipes, miss, that revises on supper, then that data is used to populate in GRMS well.There's different levels of data that is required for input, so Ingrams they're putting it in at the SPC osdp level and then again either base or OCO or non enduring or enduring.As the the highest level of roll up or the lowest level of detailed, I guess that you have to put into your amass, but they're pulling it from the peebs miss, which is at.And even lower level of data. So they're having to add a bunch of data together. Usually the osdp PPE to make sure it balances and get it put into ngrams. So right now we're just seeing a lot of different discrepancies in getting accurate information as we've got programs that report directly to us outside of the accounting system, what they're execution is, and it's not matching."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","So so I'm not 100% sure, but when I've asked the questions about whether or not what they used is their balancer for the inputs into ngrams, and they said, well, we're just balancing bottom line. Well, I understand that balancing bottom line to those in different positions, that's what their job is, but they must understand that within that data, the details matter. And when the details are not correct and they're not actually identified, the correct level of detail that we need to get right, then we end up with what we're dealing with right now and ensure AMS, which is inaccurate.Boarding."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","And a cults, you know, comments about the Peebs miss and not seeing his authority. You know, it's just because not just because but it's we have a multitude of systems that are now tracking our funding from Treasury. EFDD, which used to be.Keepass, you know, and how EFDD feeds into the different levels of accounting. The different accounting systems across the services legacy accounting systems. You have a person that that's actually uploading stuff. The new erps well. It's actually feeding in from efd so there's a whole bunch of different things going on. When we're trying to pull populated data based on the type of legacy system or ERP that the service is implemented as well as what the unit of the program is allowed to be operate in."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",It is because we don't look like the services.
581e6fdb-2eee-4d3a-9150-d1a27b4a45cd,"So we.We also support period and quarterly reconciliations and reporting requirements as well and sort of just reiterate some of the issues.We currently have with.The limitations and interfaces and data element tracking within service owned therapy.And the new funds distribute.OK, got it. Uh, systems that were utilizing.We do track some authorities in the addition to funding with.Within Ed. But that being said, we have to create unique management codes that we then paint different.Parts of funding as it's being distributed, we don't do that for every single fund distribution I guess.That's a potential solution for some of those limitations. That being said, there's no way to really reconcile those in the accounting systems because the accounting systems and the new ERP systems do not also sort of code those funds distributions for certain authorities that feeds into some of the peevishness issues as well as the fact that the twilight of the 5th and the Phoebus mess is now starting to.Impact some of those consolidated reporting requirements because.Not all of our mill debt accounting systems are feeding into those SOCOM reporting software programs, so there are gaps and shortfalls in some of those reports that historically had been relied on. But as we move into new systems interfaces for those new systems aren't being developed for this. And Bieber Smiths, while everyone waits for the Advanta suite of applications to be finalized and developed.Over."
581e6fdb-2eee-4d3a-9150-d1a27b4a45cd,"So there are advantage trainings available. I believe that there is one being conducted later this week by the OSD Advantage team.I've been involved with some of the application development and attend a lot of these weekly and biweekly updates for Advana and Sparta Environment.But a lot of those products continue to sort of be in development and then the products that are published.There is sometimes a bit of a learning curve.For.How to effectively get the information that's being compiled in those applications?To be presented properly and to be able to effectively utilize them. So that's some of the growing pains that we're going through right now with the banana. But again, a lot of just a big state of transition, especially since.Starting to move away from the fists, which has been.Sort of the.That's consistent, reliable product, even though it's a fist and the previous minutes have their own shortfall that personally think Miss is not super user friendly.I'm hoping that advana and the advantage training products that will be coming out in the future will take advanta more accessible to the user population, but.We're still just sort of in this period of transition where change requests for the 5th for no longer being prioritized cause everyone.It's trying to get to advance, but advantage just not there yet so.That's sort of where we are."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",I don't. I've not had to deal with advantage yet. I left accounting before advanta. I'd become a buzzword.
"Roberts, William C CTR USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, I haven't used it yet, but I'm eager to kind of get around and tinker and see what the capabilities are of it."
581e6fdb-2eee-4d3a-9150-d1a27b4a45cd,"Budget execution modules on nipper and zipper will be a requirement for both. Actually, all three of the sofa mass divisions. That being said, those budget execution modules aren't yet published so.As soon as they are, we'll be developing some training and probably doing some stuff within software mess trying to get everybody up to up to speed on how to use the new fifth plus two. That's miss replacements that are will be.Developed in Atlanta or."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",When are we expected to do that? Do you know Brett?
581e6fdb-2eee-4d3a-9150-d1a27b4a45cd,"That is dependent on when.Soflam, M and OSD and the CDO office finish the buzz execution application. I think that they're it was supposed to be ready for FY23. Obviously it's still in development, but I'm hoping for it to be ready tentatively, probably mid year."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Thanks.
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I mean for the fest, we could get training if we just asked for it."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I mean for fish. Yes, I would assume it'd be the same thing with advana. I think we're paying the bill for advana, aren't we?"
581e6fdb-2eee-4d3a-9150-d1a27b4a45cd,"Umm, there are. There's a couple of different clans I guess of I'm disadvantaged build contract.The SOCOM did pony up a little bit of money for, I think, data stewards program.I'm not 100% sure and.Really in the details as to what we purchased and what we're getting for our money and that. But I do know that SOCOM did provide some resourcing to support the acceleration of the Santa project."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","But this is a Comptroller lead effort. So ultimately we'd have to go to Comptroller and request for training for our enterprise if we wanted it, right."
581e6fdb-2eee-4d3a-9150-d1a27b4a45cd,"Yeah. And I think that's what is going on later this week for the accounting.Directorate, there's some.FM applications that were published in Advanta recently that I think that the accountants are starting to trained on how to use a Vanna specifically for some entitlement to accounting reconciliations, fund balance with credit free type stuff. Nothing that will really.Impact you guys until we get to.A place where you guys can actually pull.Funding and executing out of the advantage, which we're not there yet."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, basically budgetary information, because right now they're just talking what tea codes, your debits, credits, that type of reconciliation and advanta."
581e6fdb-2eee-4d3a-9150-d1a27b4a45cd,Yep.
581e6fdb-2eee-4d3a-9150-d1a27b4a45cd,I.
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Sure. We have to do is ask.
581e6fdb-2eee-4d3a-9150-d1a27b4a45cd,"Yeah, I guess that's that's sort of that's sort of what it is. I don't.I'm sure that if we needed Excel training, there's somewhere within the soft enterprise that would be able to make that available for us, but I think that.Uh.For the products that we have, there's there's training available, just like Monica said. You just have to.Reach out to whatever the.Project management offices or whoever the screen.Or."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, Excel training is offered. I've seen it. I think on the zipper dashboard, you just have to sign up for it or maybe came out an e-mail, I don't know, but I've seen it offered."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",What do you mean by upscale? I don't understand that.
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Ohh up skill not scale.
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Umm OK.Right now, I think we're just reacting to all the different systems and making sure we can get our products in on time."
"Roberts, William C CTR USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, I'd agree. I don't think our skill was really a limitation that we're experiencing right now. It's just more of dealing with the the limitations of the systems and providing the data from the A reliable source."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Exactly what he said. It's just getting the correct data out of the authoritative systems because when they go through fists, it's coming through multiple systems, crosswalks, and then JVS are entered. So yeah, it's reliable data out of the authoritative systems. That's a struggle."
"Roberts, William C CTR USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","No, I don't think Manning Resources is really a problem. So just like Monica, I came from a retired Air Force. So I've been doing a funds and and budget analyst for over 20 years, something that should take me 7 minutes to accomplish. If I only had one source such as games or gfebs is taking these seven hours to accomplish just to extract the data and collaborate it into some of these more kind of reliable and just identify what the gaps are and that that.Information."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, I think the main key is knowing your programs and understanding the specific coding structure that has been set up and promulgated across the different accounting systems. So you know what to look for and where to get it because the last thing you wanna do is hand one of your senior leaders data that is not balanced or verified or certified and that's what I think we back in this room are always questioning, is this really true, especially when we have programs telling us, Nope, that's not what we saw and what we input into our accounting system. Not sure how you're reporting, got it this way."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, it happens more times than not when you want to hit a button and it expect to have a a report done like in deems, as Cole said, deems or gfebs. That's not the case when you're up here at the headquarters and you've got MFP 11 funding that is expensed across the world in 7 to 9. How many accounting systems were at that it executes in?"
581e6fdb-2eee-4d3a-9150-d1a27b4a45cd,10 current and with the.Expiring when 12 because we're divested of two additional as well.
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. And so and when we deal with all four to five, if we're doing with no year appropriations, I mean the workload, there's a lot to do. But if you understand your programs and you know your code, you can go get it. And that's what ultimately we've had to do is go to the authoritative source vice relying on some of these.Tools that have been implemented that, as Brett alluded to, they're no longer working change requests and fists. Therefore, data is potentially not coming over correctly."
581e6fdb-2eee-4d3a-9150-d1a27b4a45cd,"I would, I would recommend, I would recommend additional FTE resources for softness accounting.Uh."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",I agree.
581e6fdb-2eee-4d3a-9150-d1a27b4a45cd,"Yeah. For the accounting piece.We have our own requirements within software mess, but that being said, I also get tagged with these.The system of record reports coming from the accounting systems for.Multiple soften directorates as well as.Other points of contact within the headquarters so.Uh, the more that these systems aren't interfacing and being consolidated accurately in the 5th, the more time I have to spend pulling these one off accounting system reports out of the various.Military Department Accounting Systems reports for various requirements across headquarters over."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","I I would say what I heard from Ivana before I left accounting and what I saw was it was an actually an amazing tool, but if they're again if you don't know and understand your programs and the coding that has been established and promulgated, you won't be able to use it to do your job, if that makes sense."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yes.
"Roberts, William C CTR USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, I don't think soft MSI has any plans to either uh, contrast or expand the the current resources. Uh II, we've gone through a recent expansion a couple years, a few years back, I guess just because of the Met program as a whole, including adding the contractor which in my position to kind of more consolidate all this data. So I can.Provide a better report to a current year execution, again for all the things we've been talking about with the disadvantages and gaps and information we have. So I think we're right sized the way we plan on staying for the near future, but again with new technologies such as advana, who knows what the future is going to show."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","First off, I'm X. We are reliant on what bigger Sophie B does and I ideally what the services are doing for the data that they're or for the systems that they're responsible for providing to our components and our T socks."
"Roberts, William C CTR USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, I think all of our reports carry a heavy role. Uh, especially when we're talking about future year budgets and justifying and defending oppositions based off of what the numbers are presenting such as the execution and obligations of the funding provided by higher headquarters. If we're providing an inaccurate data and we're saying that we're either way overspent away underspent based off the information provided to us through our current accounting systems.We we could definitely be in for an uphill battle to affect current operations and and.The the capabilities of USSOCOM I just got the meeting with OUSD and they were hit us pretty hard about obligations that are showing up in the system. But when we had our customers on the line, the the T socks and the the actual subject matter experts, there were almost every one of them are saying that they information is slightly inaccurate based off of what they're seeing out of their true accounting systems such as dams or gfebs. So we just got a meeting where.Provided.Slightly inaccurate information to the Secretary of Defense and it it definitely kind of puts us in a bad light if we're doing this consistently."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, same for sofa MSX, because we have seven annual reports that get submitted strictly directly to Congress in support of special programs. Any information that is inaccurate budgetary will have an impact because they use those annual reports as they go into the markup of the budget. So we definitely need to make sure. And then that also plays a role two to three years down the road when in our annual report, we've shown the fight up and we told them what we our out years look like. But you know, three years down the road, that doesn't happen.Well, then we have to go back through all the different positions, budget positions and the annual reports to see if the numbers were correct, see if something was misstated, et cetera. And it's just it makes it very hard when you can't go to a single system and produce a report and it stays the same when you come back to it three years later and you run the same report."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Excel wow, that's all we do back here. Yeah, we are not."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",We've tried the systems we work on. We've tried to put different like access the systems.Their system limitations that will not allow us to. So we are stubby pencil excel data sheets into Microsoft Word document.
"Roberts, William C CTR USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, same here. We'll take excel and then maybe extract the information and put on a PowerPoint to make it more palatable to non finance. Uh personnel, but lots of data sheets, lot of spreadsheets, workbooks that we we logged on a daily basis."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yes.
"Roberts, William C CTR USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","That's correct. It depends on who the audience is. But if it's, uh, another kind of a peer like another finance person that's gonna understand the data and the analytics behind it. Obviously we can give them the raw data. But to the senior leaders, we'll definitely present on a PowerPoint and make it.Kind of a more visually stimulating to ensure that they're getting the data they need without being in a dated by so much information."
"Roberts, William C CTR USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, this is."
"Roberts, William C CTR USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, there's just slight variances, especially with like the crosswalks. When we're dealing with like the the G this essay or the the the Navy and the Marine Corps.Some of the information is kind of gets lost in the gaps, or maybe it's just not as timely as real time as what they're seeing when you pull that information directly from the source, such as dams or gfebs."
"Roberts, William C CTR USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Uh, we're pulling it from fest and PS, which is really just kind of uh, consolidating the data from directly from those input sources. But again like because we all use different accounting kind of language, some things just get kind of lost in translation. Therefore it doesn't end up in the PBIS or the fifth side of the house where we can see it here at the headquarters level."
"Roberts, William C CTR USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Well, I personally don't have access to all those 11:50 systems that Brent just mentioned. But when I'm kind of going back and asking questions to the actual subject matter expert, the one that is actually executing the funds, they're showing us slight variances. And when they are able to pull directly from the input source, they can show me that, hey, you're saying this number, but I can see where fish is saying the difference and then we kind of have to kind of reconcile and kind of identify where the.The gap is and usually can identify a funding document just because of the line of accounting. What might have missed might be inconsistent with other ones. The crosswalk wasn't done properly, therefore it just didn't hit the line of accounting the way it should have been to reply to appropriately affect the status of funds that I'm pulling at my level."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Also, I think there's another layer of this, the authoritative source for, let's say, obligations.When you're talking up and out of this headquarters to OSD Comptroller, they're gonna go to what we used to be PRCP or in GMs, and they're gonna pull a status of phones for that particular fiscal year. So whatever has been loaded into ngrams is what we have to report to.So for instance, end of year 22 actuals just got posted. I've got an irregularity between my account and what's reported in arms to the tune of $21 million right now, and we're trying to figure out how we can fix it because Ngrams has locked, so by that position being locked and any product that I submit up to ASD SOLOOK or OSD Comptroller, that analyst will go into engrams, pull that status of funds, he will go look for my osdp, and then he's going to call.Baloney and say Nope, you did not you you are overreporting. What is an GRMS by 21 million? And I'm gonna say well, no, because I know this is what hit the accounting system, even though that's not what got made its way into ngrams. So I think there's an issue with.Not an issue, but I think there's a steep learning curve when people come into this community and have to actually look at and understand how to accurately report financial data up and out of this headquarters."
"Roberts, William C CTR USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Umm, so I think my biggest frustration is the number of accounting systems that were. We're using S DoD wide, like JSOC or SOCOM, just happens to be a joint community. Therefore, we're pulling information from multiple different components and services. If all the services use the same accounting system, that would make we probably cut our softcam resources by at least 10% because I think there's a lot of people that are completely focused on just consolidating the data.From all these different components to make it more accurate and more reliable, I just don't see the way that we're currently operating ever being able to accurately report to Congress where we're spinning the funds at least into a point where we're we can stamp it as a fire audit and certified by the CFO like Monica has mentioning."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah. Could say it louder. I've been saying that since I came into the accounting office up here as why doesn't OSD Comptroller mandate the use of 1 accounting system across the department?If I could change one thing, I would be doing at all because I understand what the lowest level does with inputting obligations, tracking expenditures to how it rolls up to their headquarters, and then gets reported to up here to OSD, or to excuse me to soften BI would love to be sitting over in sofam spaces when they have to do the reporting so I can make sure all my information is right, so that when I go pull it out of peeps, miss and Engg arms it all matches so that when I hand my congressional staff briefing over that, it's 100% accurate."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Well, I know, but I'd rather do it and get it correct."
581e6fdb-2eee-4d3a-9150-d1a27b4a45cd,"My recommendation would be to just Fast forward 5 or 10 years through all of these system migrations and reporting system migrations and just get to a state where even if we're not in a single accounting system.Being in maybe just four or three would be much more ideal state than where we are right now.Umm. And then also having a financial reporting.Resource that accurately and consistently reports accounting system information I think would be a.Maybe not an ideal, but a better state than where we are right now. Over."
581e6fdb-2eee-4d3a-9150-d1a27b4a45cd,"Unfortunately, a lot of these systems so comma is not the owner of. So we're very reliant on external.Variables and external entities to perform these adjustments and improvements over."
"Roberts, William C CTR USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",No question. Thanks for hosting this though.
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yeah. How many times are we going to be meeting? Is this like a working group or will it be meeting once a month or once a week?
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yep, thanks."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Yes.
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)","Yeah, same here, please. Data stewards. I'm very interested in just because I think data stewards can help document what data belongs to us and to help teach others that the things that they do have an impact on the work that we have to do. So yeah, please reach out anytime. I'd appreciate it."
"Rigaud, Monica R CIV USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Aye.
"Roberts, William C CTR USSOCOM SOCOM (USA)",Alright. Thanks victor. Thanks Sherry.
